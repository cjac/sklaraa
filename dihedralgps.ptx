  <title>Dihedral groups</title>
  <p>
    Dihedral groups are groups of symmetries of regular <m>n</m>-gons. We start with an example.
  </p>

  <example xml:id="D3">
    <p>
      Consider a regular triangle <m>T</m>, with vertices labeled <m>1</m>, <m>2</m>, and <m>3</m>. We show <m>T</m> below, also using dotted lines to indicate a vertical line of symmetry of <m>T</m> and a rotation of <m>T</m>.
    </p>
    <image source="images/b50c1bb2439484680b8b510a03e8baafdb6dce06.png"/>
    <p>
      Note that if we reflect <m>T</m> over the vertical dotted line (indicated in the picture by <m>f</m>), <m>T</m> maps onto itself, with <m>1</m> mapping to <m>1</m>, and <m>2</m> and <m>3</m> mapping to each other. Similarly, if we rotate <m>T</m> clockwise by <m>120^{\circ}</m> (indicated in the picture by <m>r</m>), <m>T</m> again maps onto itself, this time with <m>1</m> mapping to <m>2</m>, <m>2</m> mapping to <m>3</m>, and <m>3</m> mapping to <m>1</m>. Both of these maps are called <em>symmetries</em> of <m>T</m>; <m>f</m> is a <em>reflection</em> or <em>flip</em> and <m>r</m> is a <em>rotation</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Of course, these are not the only symmetries of <m>T</m>. If we compose
      two symmetries of <m>T</m>, we obtain a symmetry of <m>T</m>: for instance, if
      we apply the map <m>f\circ r</m> to <m>T</m> (meaning first do <m>r</m>, then do
      <m>f</m>) we obtain reflection over the line connecting <m>2</m> to the
      midpoint of line segment <m>\overline{13}</m>. Similarly, if we apply
      the map <m>f\circ (r\circ r)</m> to <m>T</m> (first do <m>r</m> twice, then do <m>f</m>)
      we obtain reflection over the line connecting <m>3</m> to the midpoint of
      line segment <m>\overline{12}</m>. In fact, every symmetry of <m>T</m> can be
      obtained by composing applications of <m>f</m> and applications of <m>r</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      For convenience of notation, we omit the composition symbols, writing, for instance, <m>fr</m> for <m>f\circ r</m>, <m>r\circ r</m> as <m>r^2</m>, etc. It turns out there are exactly six symmetries of <m>T</m>, namely:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            the map <m>e</m> from <m>T</m> to <m>T</m> sending every element to itself;
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <m>f</m> (that is, reflection over the line connecting <m>1</m> and the midpoint of <m>\overline{23}</m>);
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <m>r</m> (that is, clockwise rotation by <m>120^{\circ}</m>);
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <m>r^2</m> (that is, clockwise rotation by <m>240^{\circ}</m>);
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <m>fr</m> (that is, reflection over the line connecting <m>2</m> and the midpoint of <m>\overline{13}</m>); and
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <m>fr^2</m> (that is, reflection over the line connecting <m>3</m> and the midpoint of <m>\overline{12}</m>).
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
      Declaring that <m>f^0=r^0=e</m>, the set
      <me>
        D_3=\{e, f, r, r^2, fr, fr^2\}=\{f^ir^j:i=0,1, j=0,1,2\}
      </me>
      is the collection of all symmetries of <m>T</m>.
    </p>

    <remark>
      <p>
        Notice that <m>rf=fr^2</m> and that <m>f^2=r^3=e</m>.
      </p>
    </remark>

    <theorem xml:id="di3">
      <statement>
        <p>
          <m>D_3</m> is a group under composition.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>

    <proof>
      <p>
        We first show that <m>D_3</m> is closed under composition. As
        noted above, <m>rf=fr^2</m>. So any map of the form <m>f^ir^jf^kr^l</m>
        (<m>i,k=0,1</m>, <m>j,l=0,1,2</m>) can be written in the form <m>f^sr^t</m>
        for some <m>s,t \in \fatn</m>. Finally, let <m>R_2(s)</m> and <m>R_3(t)</m> be
        the remainders when you divide <m>s</m> by <m>2</m> and <m>t</m> by <m>3</m>; then
        <m>f^sr^t=f^{R_2(s)}r^{R_3(t)} \in D_3</m>. So <m>D_3</m> is closed under
        composition.
      </p>

      <p>
        Next, function composition is always associative, and the function <m>e</m> clearly acts as identity
              element
              in <m>D_3</m>. Finally,
              let <m>x=f^ir^j\in D_3</m>. Then <m>y=r^{3-j}f^{2-i}</m>
              is
              in <m>D_3</m> (since <m>D_3</m> is closed under composition) with <m>xy=yx=e</m>.
            </p>
      <p>
        Thus, <m>D_3</m> is a group.
      </p>
    </proof>

    <p>
      Let us look at <m>D_3</m> another way. Note that each map in <m>D_3</m> can be uniquely described by how it permutes the vertices <m>1,2,3</m> of <m>T</m>: that is, each map in <m>D_3</m> can be uniquely identified with a unique element of <m>S_3</m>. For instance, <m>f</m> corresponds to the permutation <m>(23)</m> in <m>S_3</m>, while <m>fr</m> corresponds to the permutation <m>(13)</m>. In turns out that <m>D_3 \simeq S_3</m>, via the following correspondence
      <me>
        \begin{array}{ccl}
        e \amp \leftrightarrow \amp  e\\
        f \amp \leftrightarrow \amp  (23)\\
        r \amp \leftrightarrow \amp  (123)\\
        r^2 \amp \leftrightarrow \amp  (132)\\
        fr \amp \leftrightarrow \amp  (13)\\
        fr^2 \amp \leftrightarrow \amp  (12)
        \end{array}
      </me>
    </p>
  </example>

  <p>
    The group <m>D_3</m> is an example of class of groups called <em>dihedral groups</em>.
  </p>

  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>n</m> be an integer greater than or equal to <m>3</m>. We
        let <m>D_n</m> be the collection of symmetries of the regular
        <m>n</m>-gon. It turns out that <m>D_n</m> is a group (see below), called
        the <term>dihedral group of order <m>2n</m></term> (Note: Some books and
        mathematicians instead denote the group of symmetries of the
        regular <m>n</m>-gon by <m>D_{2n}</m><mdash />so, for instance, our <m>D_3</m>,
        above, would instead be called <m>D_6</m>. Make sure you are aware
        of the convention your book or colleague is using.)
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <theorem xml:id="rf">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>n</m> be an integer greater than or equal to <m>3</m>. Then, again using the convention that <m>f^0=r^0=e</m>, <m>D_n</m> can be uniquely described as
        <me>
          D_n=\{f^ir^j: i=0,1, j=0,1,\ldots, n-1\}
        </me>
        with the relations
        <me>
          rf=fr^{n-1} \mbox{ and }  f^2=r^n=e.
        </me>
      </p>

      <p>
        The dihedral group <m>D_n</m> is a nonabelian group of order <m>2n</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>

  <proof>
    <p>
      The proof that <m>D_n</m> is a group parallels the proof, above, that <m>D_3</m> is a group. It is clear that <m>D_n</m> is nonabelian (e.g., <m>rf=fr^{n-1}\neq fr</m>) and has order <m>2n</m>.
    </p>
  </proof>

  <remark>
    <p>
      Throughout this course, if we are discussing a
      group <m>D_n</m> you should assume <m>n\in \Z^+</m>, <m>n\geq 3</m>, unless
      otherwise noted.
    </p>
  </remark>

  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        We say that an element of <m>D_n</m> is written in <term>standard form</term> if it is written in the form <m>f^ir^j</m> where
        <m>i\in \{0,1\}</m> and <m>j\in \{0,1,\ldots,n-1\}</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Each <m>D_n</m> is isomorphic to a subgroup of <m>S_n</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>

  <p>
    <em>Sketch of proof.</em> We described above how <m>D_3</m> is isomorphic to a subgroup
    (namely, the improper subgroup) of <m>S_3</m>. One can show that each <m>D_n</m> is isomorphic to a subgroup of <m>S_n</m> by similarly labeling the vertices of the regular <m>n</m>-gon <m>1,2,\ldots, n</m> and determining how these vertices are permuted by each element of <m>D_n</m>.
  </p>

  <warning>
    <p>
      While <m>D_3</m> is actually isomorphic to <m>S_3</m> itself, for <m>n>3</m> we have that <m>D_n</m> is <em>not</em> isomorphic to <m>S_n</m> but is rather isomorphic to a <em>proper subgroup</em> of <m>S_n</m>. When <m>n>3</m> you can see that <m>D_n</m> cannot be isomorphic to <m>S_n</m> since <m>|D_n|=2n \lt  n! = |S_n|</m> for <m>n>3</m>.
    </p>
  </warning>

  <p>
    It is important to be able to do computations with specific elements of dihedral
    groups. We have the following theorem.
  </p>

  <theorem xml:id="diords">
    <statement>
      <p>
        The following relations hold in <m>D_n</m>, for every <m>n</m>:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              For every <m>i</m>, <m>r^if=fr^{-i}</m> (in particular, <m>rf=fr^{-1}=fr^{n-1}</m>);

  <proof>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          We use induction on the exponent of <m>r</m>. We already know that <m>r^1f=fr^{-1}</m>.  Now suppose <m>r^{i-1}f=fr^{-(i-1)}</m> for some <m>i\geq 2</m>.  Then
          <me>
            r^if=r(r^{i-1}f)=r(fr^{-(i-1)})=(rf)r^{-i+1}=(fr^{-1})r^{-i+1}=fr^{-i}.

      <li>
        <p>
          For every <m>i</m>, <m>fr^i\neq e</m>, but
          <me>
            (fr^i)^2=(fr^i)(fr^i)=f(r^if)r^i=f(fr^{-i})r^i=f^2r^0=e.
