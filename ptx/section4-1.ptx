  <title>Introduction to subgroups</title>
  <p>
    Sometimes groups are too complicated to understand directly. One method that can be used to identify a group's structure is to study its <em>subgroups</em>.
  </p>

  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A <term>subgroup</term> of a group <m>G</m> is a subset of <m>G</m> that
        is also a group under <m>G</m>'s operation. If <m>H</m> is a subgroup of
        <m>G</m>, we write <m>H \leq G</m>; if <m>H\cont G</m> is not a subgroup of
        <m>G</m>, we write <m>H\not\leq G</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <warning>
    <p>
      Do not confuse sub<em>groups</em> with sub<em>sets</em>!
      All subgroups of a group <m>G</m> are, by definition, subsets of
      <m>G</m>, but not all subsets of <m>G</m> are subgroups of <m>G</m> (see
      <xref ref="subsetvsubgp1">Example</xref>, Parts 2<ndash />5, below). Whether or not
      a subset of <m>G</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m> depends on the operation
      of <m>G</m>.
    </p>

  <example xml:id="subsetvsubgp1">
    <statement>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Consider the subset <m>\Z</m> of the group <m>\fatq</m>, assuming that <m>\fatq</m> is equipped with the usual addition of real numbers (as we indicated above that we would assume, by default).  Since we already know that <m>\Z</m> is a group under this operation, <m>\Z</m> is not just a subset but in fact a subgroup of <m>\fatq</m> (under addition).
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Instead, consider the subset <m>\fatq^+</m> of the group <m>\fatq</m>.  This
            subset is <em>not</em> a group under <m>\fatq</m>'s operation <m>+</m>,
            since it does not contain an identity element for <m>+</m>.  Therefore,
            <m>\fatq^+</m> is a subset but not a subgroup of <m>\fatq</m>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Let <m>I</m> be the subset
            <me>
              I=\fatr-\fatq=\{x\in \fatr: x
              \mbox{ is irrational} \}
            </me>
            of the group <m>\fatr</m>. The set
            <m>I</m> is <em>not</em> a group under <m>\fatr</m>'s
            operation <m>+</m> since it is not closed under addition:
            for instance, <m>\pi, -\pi \in I</m>, but
            <m>\pi+(-\pi)=0\not\in I</m>.  So <m>I</m> is a subset but not a
            subgroup of <m>\fatr</m>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Consider the subset <m>\Z^+</m> of the group <m>\fatr^+</m>.
            The set <m>\Z^+</m> is closed under multiplication, multiplication is
            associative on <m>\Z^+</m>, and <m>\Z^+</m> does contain an identity element
            (namely, 1).  However, most elements of <m>\Z^+</m> do not have inverses
            in <m>\Z^+</m> under multiplication: for instance, the inverse of <m>3</m>
            would have to be <m>1/3</m>, but <m>1/3\not\in \Z^+</m>.  Therefore, <m>\Z^+</m> is
            a subset but not a subgroup of <m>\fatr^+</m>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Consider the subset <m>GL(n,\fatr)</m> of <m>\M_n(\fatr)</m>.  We know that <m>GL(n,\fatr)</m> is a group, so it might be tempting to say that it is a subgroup of <m>\M_n(\fatr)</m>; to be a subgroup of <m>\M_n(\fatr)</m>, <m>GL(n,\fatr)</m> must be a group under <m>\M_n(\fatr)</m>'s operation, which is matrix addition.  While <m>GL(n,\fatr)</m> is a group under matrix multiplication, it is not a group under matrix addition: for instance, it is not closed under matrix addition, since <m>I_n, -I_n\in GL(n,\fatr)</m> but <m>I_n+(-I_n)</m> is the matrix consisting of all zeros, which is not in <m>GL(n,\fatr)</m>. So <m>GL(n,\fatr)</m> is a subset but not a subgroup of <m>\M_n(\fatr)</m>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Consider the subset <m>H=\{0,2\}</m> of <m>\Z_4</m>.  The subset <m>H</m> is closed under addition modulo 4 (<m>0+0=0</m>, <m>0+2=2+0=2</m>, <m>2+2=0</m>), addition modulo 4 is always associative, <m>H</m> contains an identity element (namely, 0) under addition modulo 4, and both 0 and 2 have inverses in <m>\Z_4</m> under this operation (0 and 2 are each their own inverses).  Thus, <m>H</m> <em>is</em> a subgroup of <m>\Z_4</m>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Let <m>G</m> be a group.  Then <m>\{e_G\}</m> and <m>G</m> are clearly both subgroups of <m>G</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </statement>
  </example>

  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>G</m> be a group. The subgroups <m>\{e_G\}</m> and <m>G</m> of
        <m>G</m> are called the <term>trivial subgroup</term> and the <term>improper
        subgroup</term> of <m>G</m>, respectively. Not surprisingly, if <m>H\leq G</m>
        and <m>H\neq \{e_G\}</m>, <m>H</m> is called a <term>nontrivial</term> subgroup
        of <m>G</m>, and if <m>H\leq G</m> and <m>H\neq G</m>, <m>H</m> is called a <term>proper subgroup</term> of <m>G</m>.<fn>Sometimes the notation <m>H\lt G</m>
        is used to indicated that <m>H</m> is a proper subgroup of <m>G</m>, but
        sometimes it is simply used to mean that <m>H</m> is a
        subgroup<mdash />proper or improper<mdash />of <m>G</m>.</fn></p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    Note that in the cases above, we saw subsets of groups fail to be subgroups because
    they were not closed under the groups' operations; because they did not contain identity elements; or because they didn't contain an
    inverse for each of their elements. None, however, failed because the relevant group's operation was not associative on them.
    This is not a coincidence: rather, since any element of a subset of a group <m>G</m> also lives in <m>G</m>, any associative operation on <m>G</m> is of
    necessity associative on any closed subset of <m>G</m>. Therefore, when we are checking to see if <m>H\cont G</m> is a subgroup of group <m>G</m>, we need only check for
    closure, an identity element, and inverses.

  <lemma xml:id="subsame">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>G</m> be a group.
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              If <m>H</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m> then the identity element <m>e_H</m> of <m>H</m>
              is <m>e_G</m>, the identity element of <m>G</m>.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              If <m>H</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m> and <m>a\in H</m> has inverse <m>a^{-1}</m> in <m>G</m>, then <m>a</m>'s inverse in <m>H</m> is also <m>a^{-1}</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </lemma>

  <proof>
    <p>
      For Part 1: Since <m>e_H</m> is in both <m>H</m> and <m>G</m>, by the definition
      of <m>e_H</m>, we have
      <m>e_He_H=e_H</m>, and by the definition of <m>e_G</m> we have <m>e_Ge_H=e_H</m>. So <m>e_He_H=e_Ge_H</m>, and thus by right
      cancellation, <m>e_H=e_G</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Next, for Part 2, let <m>b</m> be the inverse of <m>a</m> in <m>H</m>. Then using Part 1 of this lemma and the definition of an inverse, <m>ab=e_H=e_G=aa^{-1}</m>. By left cancellation, then, we have that <m>b=a^{-1}</m>.
    </p>
  </proof>

  <corollary>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>H\subseteq G</m>. If the identity element of <m>G</m> is not in <m>H</m>, then <m>H\not\leq G</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
