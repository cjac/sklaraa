  <title>Sets</title>
  <p>
    Now we provide a <q>definition</q> of a basic mathematical object to which we will soon add bells and whistles.
  </p>

  <p>
    \begin{df}{<q>Sort of</q> definition} A <em>set</em> is an (unordered)
    collection of objects.\end{df}
  </p>

  <p>
    We say this is a <q>sort of</q> definition because it is not a
    rigorous definition of a set. For instance, what do we mean by a
    <q>collection</q> of objects? This <q>definition</q> will be sufficient for
    our course, but be warned that defining a set in this vague way can
    lead to some serious mathematical issues, such as Russell's
    paradox<fn>Let <m>S</m> be the set of all sets that aren't members
    of themselves.  Is <m>S</m> a member of itself? If you think carefully
    about this, you'll see that <m>S</m> can be neither a member of itself,
    nor <em>not</em> a member of itself. Uh oh!  This contradiction
    is known as Russell's paradox (named for the British philosopher, mathematician, and all-round academic Bertrand Russell). Mathematicians deal with this by
    declaring that some object collections, called <em>classes</em>, are
    not in fact sets.</fn>; a mathematician whose expertise is in set
    theory may scowl disagreeably if you try to define a set as we have
    above.

  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The members of a set are called its <term>elements</term>. If
        <m>S</m> is a set, we write <m>x\in S</m> to indicate ``<m>x</m> is an element
        of <m>S</m>," and <m>x \not\in S</m> to indicate ``<m>x</m> is not an element
        of <m>S</m>." There is a unique set containing no elements; it is
        called the <term>empty set</term>, and denoted by <m>\emptyset</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    Sets must be <em>well defined</em>: that is, it must be clear
    exactly which objects are in a set, and which objects aren't.
    For instance, the set of all integers is well defined, but the
    set of all big integers is not well defined, since it is
    unclear what <q>big</q> means in this context.
  </p>

  <p>
    We refer to some sets so frequently in mathematics that we have special notation for them. Common examples are:

  <p>
    We also provide notation for commonly considered sets of matrices:
  </p>

  <emph>Notation.</emph> 
 Given <m>m,n\in \Z^+</m> and a set <m>S</m>, we define <m>\M_{m\times n}(S)</m> to
    be the set of all <m>m\times n</m> matrices over <m>S</m> (that is, of all <m>m\times n</m> matrices with entries in <m>S</m>). We use the
    shorthand notation <m>\M_n(S)</m> for the set <m>\M_{n\times n}(S)</m>.
  
  <p>
    One common way of describing a set is to list its elements in
    curly braces, separated by commas; you can use ellipses to
    indicate a repeated pattern of elements. A few examples are
    <m>\{1,4,\pi\}</m>, <m>\{3, 4, 5, \ldots\}</m>, and <m>\{\ldots, -4, -2, 0,
    2, 4, \ldots\}</m>; the last of these can be written more concisely as <m>\{0,\pm 2, \pm 4,\ldots\}</m>. Note that since elements of a set are
    unordered, the sets <m>\{1,4,\pi\}</m> and <m>\{4,\pi, 1\}</m>, for
    instance, are identical.
  </p>

  <p>
    Another method is using <em>set-builder notation</em>. This consists of an element name (or
    names), followed by a colon (meaning <q>such that</q>), followed by
    a Boolean expression involving the element name(s), all
    surrounded by curly braces.<fn><em>WARNING:</em> The use of a colon to denote <q>such that</q> is <em>only</em> valid in the above set-builder notation context.  Outside of this context, you should never use a colon to denote <q>such that</q>; instead, write out the actual words or use the abbreviation s.t. (or the symbol <m>\ni</m>, though I do not recommended).  Conversely, never use one of those ways of indicating <q>such that</q> within set-builder notation; always use a colon there.  Why?  Convention.</fn>For example,
    <me>
      \{x\in \Z : x > 4\}
    </me>
    is the set <m>\{5, 6, 7, \ldots\}</m>, while
    <me>
      \{z\in \C : |z|=1\}
    </me>
    is the set of all complex numbers at
    distance 1 from the origin in the complex plane.
  </p>

  <note>

  <p>
    If one simply writes <m>\{x\,:\,x>4\}</m>,
    it is unclear what this set is; it could be the set of all
    integers greater than 4, or the set of all real numbers greater
    than 4, or something else. When one can, it is better to
    identify the named element(s) as a member (members) of a known
    set, such as <m>\R</m> or <m>\Z</m>, whenever possible.

        Set <m>A</m> is a <term>subset</term> of <m>B</m> (and set <m>B</m> is a <term>superset</term> of <m>A</m>) if every element in <m>A</m> is also in <m>B</m>. We
        denote <q><m>A</m> is a subset of <m>B</m></q> by <m>A\subseteq B</m>. Sets <m>A</m>
        and <m>B</m> are said to be <term>equal</term>, and we write <m>A=B</m>, if they
        contain exactly the same elements; equivalently, <m>A=B</m> if and
        only if <m>A \subseteq B</m> and <m>B\subseteq A</m>. Set <m>A</m> is a <term>proper</term> subset of set <m>B</m> if <m>A\subseteq B</m> but <m>A\neq B</m>; we
        write this <m>A\subsetneq B</m> or <m>A\subset B</m><fn><em>
        WARNING:</em> Sometimes the notation <m>A\subset B</m> is merely used to
        indicate that <m>A</m> is a subset of <m>B</m> (but may equal <m>B</m>). Be
        careful to check what your book or peer means by this
        notation.</fn>.

  <remark>
    <p>
      One often proves that two sets <m>A</m> and
      <m>B</m> are equal by proving that <m>A\cont B</m> and <m>B\cont A</m>.

        The <term>power set</term> of <m>A</m>, denoted <m>P(A)</m>, is the set of
        all subsets of <m>A</m>. (Note that the power set of any set
        contains the empty set as an element.)
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <warning>
    <p>
      Be careful to use your curly braces correctly when writing power sets!
      Remember, the power set of a set is a <em>set of sets</em>.

  <p>
    The following provides a good example of using braces correctly.

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>A=\{a,b\}</m>, then <m>P(A)=\{\emptyset, \{a\}, \{b\}, \{a,b\}\}</m>. Note that the element <m>\{a,b\}</m> of <m>P(A)</m> could also be written simply as <m>A</m>.

            If <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are sets, then the <em>union</em> of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>, denoted <m>A\cup B</m>, is the set
            <m>A\cup B=\{x: x\in A \mbox{ or }  x\in B\};</m> the <em>intersection</em> of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>, denoted <m>A\cap B</m>, is the set
            <m>A\cap B=\{x: x\in A \mbox{ and }  x\in B\};</m> and the <em>difference</em> of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>, denoted <m>A-B</m> (or <m>A\setminus B</m>), is the set

          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            More generally, given any collection of sets <m>A_i</m> (<m>i</m> in some index set <m>I</m>), the <em>union</em> of the <m>A_i</m> is
            <me>
              \bigcup_{i\in I}A_i=\{x: x\in A_i \mbox{ for some }  i\in I\},

          <p>
            Sets <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are <em>disjoint</em> if <m>A\cap B=\emptyset</m>.  More generally, sets <m>A_i</m> (<m>i</m> in some index set <m>I</m>) are
            <em>disjoint</em> if
            <me>
              \bigcap_{i\in I}A_i=\emptyset
            </me>
            and are <em>mutually disjoint</em> if
            <me>
              A_i\cap A_j=\emptyset \mbox{ for all } i\neq j \in I.

        </li>

    </statement>

  <p>
    Notice that for any sets <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>, <m>A\cap B \cont A \cont A\cup B</m> and
    <m>A\cap B \cont B \cont A\cup B</m>. Also note that if sets <m>A_i</m> (<m>i \in I</m>) are mutually disjoint then they are also disjoint, but they may be disjoint without being mutually disjoint. For example, the sets <m>\{i, i+1\}</m> for <m>i\in \Z</m> are disjoint but not mutually disjoint. (Do you see why?)

    We define one more way of <q>combining</q> sets.

  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be sets. Then the <term>direct product</term> (or <term>Cartesian 
        product</term>) <m>A\times B</m> of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> is the set

          A\times B =

      <p>
        An element <m>(a,b)</m> of
        <m>A\times B</m> is called an <term>ordered pair</term>. More generally, if
        <m>A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n</m> are sets for some <m>n\in \Z^+</m>, then the
        <term>product</term> of the <m>A_i</m> is
        <me>
          A_1\times A_2 \times \cdots

          } i=1,2, \ldots, n\}; 
        </me>
        the elements <m>(a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n)</m> of this
        product are called <m>n</m>-tuples (or triples, if <m>n=3</m>).<fn>You can also have products of infinitely many sets, but we will
        not discuss that in this course.</fn>Finally, if each set <m>A_i</m> is
        the same set <m>A</m>, we can use the notation <m>A^n</m> to denote the
        product
        <me>
          A\times A \times \cdots \times A
