  <title>The definition of a group</title>
  <p>
    At this point you may be asking yourself, why do we care? We've covered a lot of definitions and proved some theorems, but what is the goal of all this? Well, there are actually many goals that we can achieve using such material. Consider the following as an example. Suppose we want to solve the equation <m>5+x=2</m>. We can probably solve this quite easily almost just by looking at it (<m>x=-3</m>), but what facts are we actually using there? If we break down the reasoning leading to this answer, we may obtain something like the following set of steps.
  </p>
  <tabular>
    <row>
      <cell></cell>
      <cell><m>5+x</m></cell>
      <cell>=</cell>
      <cell><m>2</m></cell>
      <cell></cell>
    </row>
    <row>
      <cell><m>\Rightarrow</m></cell>
      <cell><m>-5+(5+x)</m></cell>
      <cell>=</cell>
      <cell><m>-5+2</m></cell>
      <cell></cell>
    </row>
    <row>
      <cell><m>\Rightarrow</m></cell>
      <cell><m>(-5+5)+x</m></cell>
      <cell>=</cell>
      <cell><m>-3</m></cell>
      <cell></cell>
    </row>
    <row>
      <cell><m>\Rightarrow</m></cell>
      <cell><m>0+x</m></cell>
      <cell>=</cell>
      <cell><m>-3</m></cell>
      <cell></cell>
    </row>
    <row>
      <cell><m>\Rightarrow</m></cell>
      <cell><m>x</m></cell>
      <cell>=</cell>
      <cell><m>-3</m></cell>
      <cell>.</cell>
    </row>
  </tabular>
  <p>
    In line 2, we add the inverse of <m>5</m> in <m>\langle \Z, +\rangle</m> to each side of
    the equation. In line 3, we use associativity of <m>+</m> in <m>\Z</m> (along
    with computation), while in line 4 we use the fact that <m>-5</m> is the
    additive inverse of <m>5</m> (that is, the inverse of <m>5</m> in <m>\Z</m> under
    <m>+</m>). Finally, in line 5 we use the fact that 0 is an additive
    identity element in <m>\Z</m> (that is, the identity element in <m>\Z</m>
    under <m>+</m>).
  </p>

  <p>
    In summary, we used <em>associativity, identity elements, and
    inverses</em> in <m>\Z</m> to solve the given equation. This perhaps
    suggests that these would be useful traits for a binary
    structure and/or its operation to have. They are in fact so
    useful that a binary structure displaying these characteristics
    is given a special name. We note that these axioms are rather
    strong; <q>most</q> binary structures aren't groups.
  </p>

  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A <term>group</term> is a set <m>G</m>, equipped with a binary
        operation <m>*</m>, that satisfies the following three <term>group
        axioms</term>:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>*</m> is associative on <m>G</m> (we call this axiom <m>\G_1</m>)
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              There exists an identity element for <m>*</m> in <m>G</m> (axiom <m>\G_2</m>)
            </p>
          </li>

          <li> <p>
              Every element <m>a\in G</m> has an inverse in <m>G</m> (axiom <m>\G_3</m>)

            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        We
        denote group <m>G</m> under <m>*</m> by the binary structure notation
        <m>\langle G,*\rangle</m>, or simply by <m>G</m> if the operation <m>*</m> is known
        from context (or need not be known in the current
        situation).
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

 
 <remark>
<p>
  When proving/disproving that a set <m>G</m> is/is
    not a group under an (apparent) operation <m>*</m>:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          The first thing you should do is check to make sure that  <m>\langle G,*\rangle</m>
          is a binary structure by making sure <m>G</m> is closed under <m>*</m><mdash />if not, it doesn't make sense to
          check to see if axioms <m>\G_1</m><ndash /><m>\G_3</m> hold). (For instance: <m>\Z^*</m> has no chance of being a group under
          <m>\div</m>, since, e.g., <m>3,4\in \Z^*</m> but <m>3 \div 4 \not\in\Z^*</m>.)
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          You should never check <m>\G_3</m> before confirming
          <m>\G_2</m> holds, because it makes no sense to look for
          inverses if you haven't confirmed that <m>G</m> contains an
          identity element under <m>*</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul></p>
