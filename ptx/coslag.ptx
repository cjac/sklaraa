  <title>The Wonderful World of Cosets</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      We have already seen one way we can examine a complicated group <m>G</m>:
      namely, study its subgroups, whose group structures are in some
      cases much more directly understandable than the structure of <m>G</m>
      itself. But if <m>H</m> is a subgroup of a group <m>G</m>, if we only study
      <m>H</m> we lose all the information about <m>G</m>'s structure <q>outside</q> of
      <m>H</m>. We might hope that <m>G-H</m> (that is, the set of elements of <m>G</m>
      that are not in <m>H</m>) is also a subgroup of <m>G</m>, but we immediately
      see that cannot be the case since the identity element of <m>G</m> must
      be in <m>H</m>, and <m>H\cap (G-H)=\emptyset</m>. Instead, let's ask how we
      can get at some understanding of <m>G</m>'s entire structure using a
      subgroup <m>H</m>? It turns out we use what are called <em>cosets</em> of
      <m>H</m>; but before we get to those, we need to cover some preliminary
      material.
