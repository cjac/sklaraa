    <statement>
      <p>
        When <m>A=\{1,2,\ldots, n\}</m> (<m>n\in \Z^+</m>), we call <m>S_A</m>
        the <term>symmetric group on <m>n</m> letters</term> and denote it by
        <m>S_n</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <remark>
    <p>
      Throughout this course, if we are discussing a
      group <m>S_n</m>, you should assume <m>n\in \Z^+</m>.
    </p>
  </remark>

  <p>
    It is important for us to be able to easily describe specific elements of <m>S_n</m>. It would be cumbersome to describe, for instance, an element of <m>S_3</m> by saying it swaps <m>1</m> and <m>2</m> and fixes <m>3</m>; imagine how much more cumbersome it could be to describe an element of, say, <m>S_{100}</m>! One can somewhat concisely describe a permutation <m>\sigma</m> of <m>S_n</m> by listing out the elements <m>1,2,\ldots,n</m> and writing the element <m>\sigma(i)</m> below each <m>i</m> for <m>i=1,2,\ldots, n</m>.
    For instance, if <m>\sigma</m> sends <m>1</m> to <m>2</m>, we'd write the number <m>2</m> below the number <m>1</m>. The convention is to enclose these two rows of numbers in a single set of parentheses, as in the following example.
  </p>

  <example xml:id="nocommute">
    <statement>
      <p>
        We can denote the element <m>\sigma</m> of <m>S_3</m> that swaps <m>1</m> and <m>2</m> and fixes <m>3</m> by
        <me>
          \sigma = \left(\begin{array}{ccc}1\amp 2\amp 3\\ 2\amp 1\amp 3
          \end{array} \right),
        </me>
        and the element <m>\tau</m> of <m>S_3</m> that sends <m>1</m> to <m>3</m>, <m>2</m> to <m>1</m>, and <m>3</m> to <m>2</m> by
        <me>
          \tau =\left(\begin{array}{ccc}1\amp 2\amp 3\\ 3\amp 1\amp 2
          \end{array} \right).
        </me>
      </p>

      <p>
        Then
        <me>
          \sigma\tau = \left(\begin{array}{ccc}1\amp 2\amp 3\\ 3\amp 2\amp 1
          \end{array} \right) \mbox{ and } 
          \tau\sigma = \left(\begin{array}{ccc}1\amp 2\amp 3\\ 1\amp 3\amp 2
          \end{array} \right) .
        </me>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>

  <p>
    But even this notation is unnecessarily cumbersome. Instead, we
    use <em>cycle notation</em>.

        A permutation <m>\sigma</m> in <m>S_n</m> is called a <term><m>k</m>-cycle</term> or a <term>cycle of length <m>k</m></term> (or, less
        specifically, a <term>cycle</term>) if there exist elements <m>a_1,
        a_2,\ldots, a_k</m> in <m>\{1,2,\ldots,n\}</m> such that
      </p>
      <tabular>
        <row>
          <cell><m>\sigma(a_i)=a_{i+1}</m> for each <m>i=1,2,\ldots, k-1</m>;</cell>
        </row>
        <row>
          <cell><m>\sigma(a_k)=a_1</m>; and</cell>
        </row>
        <row>
          <cell><m>\sigma(x)=x</m> for every other element of <m>\{1,2,\ldots, n\}</m>.</cell>
        </row>
      </tabular>
      <p>
        We use the <term>cycle notation</term> <m>\sigma = (a_1 a_2 \cdots a_k)</m> to describe such a cycle. A <m>2</m>-cycle is often called a <term>transposition</term>.
      </p>
    </statement>

  <example xml:id="tr">
    <statement>
      <p>
        The permutation <m>\tau</m> in <m>S_3</m> that sends <m>1</m> to <m>3</m>, <m>2</m> to <m>1</m>, and <m>3</m> to <m>2</m> is a cycle. It can be denoted by <m>\tau =(132)</m>.
        Similarly, the cycle <m>\rho</m> in <m>S_3</m> swapping <m>1</m> and <m>3</m> can be denoted by <m>\rho=(13)</m>. On the other hand, the permutation in <m>S_4</m> that swaps <m>1</m> with <m>2</m> and <m>3</m> with <m>4</m> is
        <em>not</em> a cycle.

  <remark>
    <p>
      Given a <m>k</m>-cycle <m>\sigma=(a_1 a_2\cdots a_k)</m>, there are <m>k</m> different expressions for <m>\sigma</m>. Indeed, we have
      <me>
        \sigma=(a_1 a_2\cdots a_k)=(a_2 a_3 \cdots a_k a_1)=(a_3 a_4 \cdots a_k a_1 a_2)=\cdots = (a_k a_1 \cdots a_{k-1}).

        The permutation <m>\tau</m> described in <xref ref="tr">Example</xref> can also be written as <m>(321)</m> and as <m>(213)</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>

  <p>
    However, by convention, we usually <q>start</q> a cycle <m>\sigma</m>
    with the smallest of the numbers that <m>\sigma</m> doesn't fix: e.g.,
    we'd write <m>\sigma=(213)</m> as <m>(132)</m>.

    <statement>
      <p>
        Two cycles <m>\sigma=(a_1 a_2 \cdots a_k)</m> and <m>\tau=(b_1
        b_2 \cdots b_m)</m> are said to be <term>disjoint</term> if <m>a_i \neq
        b_j</m> for all <m>i</m> and <m>j</m>. Cycles <m>\sigma_1</m>,
        <m>\sigma_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>, <m>\sigma_m</m> are <term>disjoint</term> if <m>\sigma_i</m>
        and <m>\sigma_j</m> are disjoint for each <m>i \neq j</m>. (Notice: this
        version of disjointness is what we usually refer to as <term>mutual</term> disjointness.)

  <remark>
    <p>
      Note that if cycles <m>\sigma</m> and <m>\tau</m> are disjoint, then <m>\sigma</m> and <m>\tau</m> commute; that is, <m>\sigma \tau=\tau \sigma</m>.
    </p>
  </remark>

  <warning>
    <p>
      If cycles <m>\sigma</m> and <m>\tau</m> are <em>not</em> disjoint then they may not commute. For instance, see <xref ref="nocommute">Example</xref>, where <m>\sigma\tau \neq \tau \sigma</m>.
    </p>
  </warning>

  <p>
    Note that any permutation of <m>S_n</m> is a product of disjoint cycles (where by <q>product</q> we mean the permutation resulting from permutation multiplication).
  </p>

  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Writing a permutation in <term>(disjoint)
        cycle notation</term> means writing it as a product of disjoint
        cycles, where each cycle is written in cycle notation.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <remark>
    <p>
      Note that if <m>\sigma</m> in <m>S_n</m> is
      written in cycle notation and the number <m>a\in \{1,2,\ldots, n\}</m>
      appears nowhere in <m>\sigma</m>'s representation, this means that
      <m>\sigma</m> fixes <m>a</m>. The only permutation that we cannot really write
      in cycle notation is the identity element <m>1_A</m> of <m>S_A</m>, which we
      henceforth denote by <m>e</m>.
    </p>
  </remark>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The permutation
        <me>
          \sigma =\left(\begin{array}{cccccc}1\amp 2\amp 3\amp 4\amp 5\amp 6\\ 3\amp 1\amp 2\amp 6\amp 5\amp 4
          \end{array} \right)
        </me>
        is the product of disjoint cycles
        <m>(132)</m> and <m>(46)</m>, so in cycle notation we have
        <me>
          \sigma=(132)(46).
        </me>
      </p>

      <p>
        Note that we could also write <m>\sigma</m> as <m>(321)(46)</m>, <m>(213)(64)</m>, <m>(64)(132)</m>, etc.
      </p>

      <p>
        While it is true that we also have <m>\sigma=(13)(23)(46)</m>, this is not a disjoint cycle representation of <m>\sigma</m> since both <m>(13)</m> and <m>(23)</m> <q>move</q> the element <m>3</m>.

    <statement>
      <p>
        Any <m>k</m>-cycle has order <m>k</m> in <m>S_n</m>. More generally, if permutation <m>\sigma</m> can be written in disjoint cycle notation as <m>\sigma=\sigma_1 \sigma_2 \cdots \sigma_m</m>, then

          <mrow>o(\sigma)\amp =\lcm(o(\sigma_1), o(\sigma_2),\ldots, o(\sigma_m))</mrow>

  <warning>
    <p>
      Permutation <m>\sigma</m> must be in <em>disjoint</em> cycle notation for the above formula to hold. For instance, let <m>\sigma=(12)(23)</m> in <m>S_3</m>. The transpositions <m>(12)</m> and <m>(23)</m> both have order <m>2</m>, but <m>o(\sigma)\neq \lcm(2,2)=2</m>. Rather, <m>o(\sigma)=3</m>, since in disjoint cycle notation <m>\sigma</m> can be written as <m>\sigma=(123)</m>. You must write a permutation using disjoint cycle notation before attempting to use this method to compute its order!
