  <title>Introduction to cyclic groups</title>
  <p>
    Certain groups and subgroups of groups have particularly nice structures.

  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A group is <term>cyclic</term> if it is isomorphic to <m>\Z_n</m> for some <m>n\geq 1</m>, or if it is isomorphic to <m>\Z</m>.

        Examples/nonexamples of cyclic groups.

          <li>
            <p>
              <m>n\Z</m> and <m>\Z_n</m> are cyclic for every <m>n\in \Z^+</m>.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <m>\R</m>, <m>\R^*</m>, <m>\M_2(\R)</m>, and <m>GL(2,\R)</m> are uncountable and hence can't be cyclic.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <m>\Z_2^2</m> is <em>not</em> cyclic since it would have to be isomorphic to <m>\Z_4</m> if it were (since it has order 4).
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <m>\Q</m> isn't cyclic. If it were cyclic it would have to be isomorphic to <m>\Z</m>, since <m>\Q</m>
              is an infinite group (so can't be isomorphic to <m>\Z_n</m> for any <m>n</m>). But we showed in <xref ref="zq">Example</xref> that <m>\Q \not\simeq \Z</m>.

      Clearly, cyclicity is a group invariant.

  <theorem xml:id="abcyc">
    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>G</m> is cyclic, then <m>G</m> is abelian; however, <m>G</m>
        can be abelian but not cyclic.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>

  <proof>
    <p>
      Since <m>\Z</m> and each <m>\Z_n</m> are abelian, every cyclic group is abelian. But, for instance, <m>\R</m> is an abelian noncyclic group (it can't be cyclic because it is uncountable).
    </p>
  </proof>

  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>a</m> be an element of a group <m>G</m>. Then
        <me>
          \langle a\rangle  = \{a^n:n\in \Z\}=\{\ldots, a^{-2},a^{-1},a^0,a^1,a^2,\ldots\}
        </me>
        is called the <term>(cyclic) subgroup of <m>G</m> generated by <m>a</m></term>.
        (We will later see why the words <q>cyclic</q> and
        <q>generated</q> are used here.)
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <remark>
    <p>
      Note that in the above definition, we were using
      multiplicative notation. Using additive notation, we have
      <m>\langle a\rangle =\{na:n\in \Z\}=\{\ldots, -2a, -a, 0a, 1a, 2a, \ldots\}.</m>
    </p>
  </remark>

  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>a</m> be an element of a group <m>G</m>. Then <m>\langle a\rangle \leq G</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>

  <proof>
    <p>
      Let <m>x,y\in \langle a\rangle</m>. Then <m>x=a^i</m>, <m>y=a^j</m> for some <m>i,j\in \Z</m>. So <m>xy=a^ia^j=a^{i+j}\in \langle a\rangle</m>. Next, <m>e_G=a^0\in H</m>. Finally, <m>(a^i)^{-1}=a^{-i}\in H</m>. So <m>\langle a\rangle</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m>.
    </p>
  </proof>

  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>G</m> be a group with identity element <m>e</m>, and let <m>a\in G</m>. Then the group <m>\langle a\rangle</m> is cyclic.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>

  <proof>
  <p>
    <em>Case 1.</em> There is no positive integer <m>k</m> with <m>a^k=e</m>. In this case, we claim <m>\langle a\rangle \simeq \Z</m>. Indeed: Let <m>\phi:\Z\to \langle a\rangle</m> be defined by <m>\phi(i)=a^i</m>. Clearly, <m>\phi</m> is a homomorphism that is onto. So to show that <m>\phi</m> is an isomorphism, it suffices to show that <m>\phi</m> is one-to-one. Let <m>i,j\in \Z</m> with <m>\phi(i)=\phi(j)</m>. Then <m>a^i=a^j</m>. Without loss of generality, we may assume <m>i\geq j</m>. Then, multiplying both sides of the equation by <m>a^{-j}</m> (on the right or on the left) we obtain <m>a^{i-j}=e</m>. Since <m>i-j\in \N</m> and there is no positive integer <m>k</m> with <m>a^k=e</m>, we must have <m>i-j=0</m>, so <m>i=j</m>. Thus, <m>\phi</m> is an isomorphism from <m>\Z</m> to <m>\langle a\rangle</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Case 2.</em> There is a positive integer <m>k</m> such that <m>a^k=e</m>. In this case, let <m>n</m> be the <em>least</em> such positive integer. In this case, we claim <m>\langle a\rangle \simeq \Z_n</m>. Indeed: Let <m>\phi:\Z_n\to \langle a\rangle</m> be defined by <m>\phi(i)=a^i</m>. We will find it useful to use the following, which holds in this context:
  </p>

  <lemma>
    <statement>
    <p>
      <em>(Clock Lemma)</em> If <m>s,t\in \Z</m>, then <m>a^s=a^t</m> if and only if <m>s</m> is congruent to <m>t</m> modulo <m>n</m>.
    </p>
    </statement>
  </lemma>

  <proof>
    <p>
      By the Division Algorithm, there exist <m>q\in \Z</m> and <m>r\in \Z_n</m> with <m>s-t=qn+r</m>. Then <m>a^{s-t}=a^{qn+r}=(a^n)^qa^r=e^qa^r=a^r</m>. Since <m>0\leq r\lt n</m>, be definition of <m>n</m> we have that <m>a^{s-t}=e</m> if and only if <m>r=0</m>; that is, <m>a^s=a^t</m> if and only if <m>s</m> and <m>t</m> are congruent modulo <m>n</m>.
    </p>
  </proof>

  <p>
    Let <m>i,j\in \Z</m>. We want to show that <m>\phi(i+_nj)=\phi(i)\phi(j)</m>, that is, that <m>a^{i+_nj}=a^ia^j</m>. Since <m>i+j</m> is congruent to <m>i+_nj</m> modulo <m>n</m>, <m>a^ia^j=a^{i+j}=a^{i+_nj}</m>, by the Clock Lemma. So <m>\phi</m> is a homomorphism. Next we show that <m>\phi</m> is one-to-one. Let <m>i,j\in \Z_n</m> with <m>\phi(i)=\phi(j)</m>, so <m>a^i=a^j</m>. Then, by the Clock Lemma, <m>i</m> and <m>j</m> are congruent modulo <m>n</m>. Since they're both in <m>\Z_n</m>, they must be equal,
    so <m>\phi</m> is one-to-one. Finally, we show that <m>\phi</m> is onto. let <m>x\in \langle a\rangle</m>. Then <m>x=a^i</m> for some <m>i\in \Z</m>. Letting <m>r</m> be the remainder when we divide <m>i</m> by <m>n</m>, we have <m>r\in \Z_n</m> with <m>i</m> congruent to <m>r</m> modulo <m>n</m>; so, again using the Clock Lemma, <m>x=a^i=a^r</m>. Since <m>r\in \Z_n</m>, <m>x=\phi(r)</m>. So <m>\phi</m> is onto. Thus, <m>\phi</m> is an isomorphism.
  </p>
  </proof>

  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>G</m> be a group and let <m>a\in G</m>. We define the <term>order</term> of <m>a</m>, denoted <m>o(a)</m>, to be <m>|\langle a\rangle |</m>. (Note: If there exists a positive integer <m>k</m> such that <m>a^k=e</m>, then the least such integer is the order of <m>a</m>; otherwise, <m>o(a)=\infty</m>.)
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <remark>
    <p>
      Do not confuse the order of a group with the order
      of an <em>element of a group</em>. These are related concepts, but they are distinct, and have distinct
      notations: as we've seen, the order of a group, <m>G</m>, is denoted by
      <m>|G|</m>, while the order of an element <m>a</m> of a group is denoted by
      <m>o(a)</m>.
    </p>
  </remark>

  <p>
    We have the following handy theorem.
  </p>

  <theorem xml:id="invord">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>a\in G</m>. Then <m>o(a)=o(a^{-1})</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>

  <proof>
    <p>
      First, assume <m>o(a)=n\lt \infty</m>. Then
      <me>
        (a^{-1})^n=(a^n)^{-1}=e^{-1}=e,
      </me>
      so <m>o(a^{-1})\leq n=o(a)</m>. Using the same argument, we have <m>n=o(a)\leq o(a^{-1})</m>. Since <m>o(a^{-1})\leq n</m> and <m>n\leq o(a^{-1})</m>, <m>o(a^{-1})=n=o(a)</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      On the other hand, assume <m>o(a)= \infty</m>. Then <m>a^{-1}</m> must also have infinite order, since if it had finite order <m>m</m>, <m>a</m> would, by the above argument, have order less than or equal to <m>m</m>.
    </p>
  </proof>

  <p>
    Unfortunately, there's no formula one can simply use to compute the order
    of an element in an arbitrary group. However, in the special case
    that the group is cyclic of order <m>n</m>, we do have such a formula. We
    present the following result without proof.
  </p>

  <theorem xml:id="znorders">
    <statement>
      <p>
        For each <m>a\in \Z_n</m>, <m>o(a)=n/\gcd(n,a)</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>

      Note, however, that just because the orders of elements of two groups <q>match up</q> the groups need not be isomorphic. For example, every element of <m>\Z</m> has infinite order, except for its identity element, which has order 1; the same is true for the group <m>\Q</m>. However, we have previously proven that these groups are not isomorphic.
