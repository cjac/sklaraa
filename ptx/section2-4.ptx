  <title>Examples of groups/nongroups, Part I</title>
  <p>
    Let's look at some examples of groups/nongroups.
  </p>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        We claim that <m>\Z</m> is a group under addition. Indeed, we already
        know that <m>\Z</m> is closed under addition and that addition is
        associative on the integers. The integer <m>0</m> acts as an identity
        element of <m>\Z</m> under addition (since <m>a+0=0+a=a</m> for each <m>a\in
        \Z</m>), and each element <m>a</m> in <m>G</m> has inverse <m>-a</m> since
        <m>a+(-a)=-a+a=0</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            For each following binary structure <m>\langle G,*\rangle</m>, determine whether or not <m>G</m> is a group.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            For those that are <em>not </em> groups, determine the first group axiom  that fails, and provide a proof that it fails.

  <p>
    If you have taken
    linear algebra, you have also probably seen a collection of matrices
    that is a group under matrix multiplication.
  </p>

  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        For <m>n\in \Z^+</m>, we define <m>GL(n,\R)</m> by
        <me>
          GL(n,\R):=\{M\in \M_n(\R):\det M \neq 0\}.
        </me>
      </p>

      <p>
        In other
        words, <m>G</m> is the set of all invertible <m>n\times n</m> matrices
        over <m>\R</m>. We also define subset <m>SL(n,\R)</m> of
        <m>GL(n,\R)</m>, by
        <me>
          SL(n,\R):=\{M\in \M_n(\R):\det M =1\}.
        </me>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <notation>

  <p>
    We may use the notation <m>\0</m> to denote a zero matrix and <m>I_n</m> to denote an <m>n\times n</m> identity matrix.
  </p>

  </notation>

  <remark>
    <p>
      Throughout this course, if we are discussing a set <m>GL(n,\R)</m> or <m>SL(n,\R)</m>, you should assume <m>n\in \Z^+</m>, unless otherwise noted.
    </p>
  </remark>

  <theorem xml:id="glsl">
    <statement>
      <p>
        <m>GL(n,\R)</m> and <m>SL(n,\R)</m> are closed under matrix multiplication (so <m>\langle GL(n,\R),\cdot\rangle</m> and <m>\langle SL(n,\R),\cdot\rangle</m> are binary structures).
      </p>
    </statement>

  <proof>
    <p>
      Let <m>A,B\in GL(n, \R)</m>. Then <m>\det(AB)=(\det A)(\det B) \neq 0</m> (since <m>\det A, \det B \neq 0)</m>, so <m>AB\in GL(n,\R)</m>. Similarly, if <m>A,B \in SL(n,\R)</m>, then <m>\det(AB)=(\det A)(\det B)=1(1)=1</m>, so <m>AB\in SL(n,\R)</m>.
    </p>
  </proof>

  </theorem>

  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The binary structures
        <m>GL(n,\R)</m> and <m>SL(n,\R)</m> are groups under matrix multiplication.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Let <m>G:=GL(n,\R)</m>. We show that <m>G</m>, under matrix multiplication, satisfies
        the three group axioms. First, we know that matrix multiplication is always associative. Next, the <m>n\times n</m> identity matrix
              <me>
                I_n:=\begin{bmatrix}1 \amp  0 \amp  0 \amp  \cdots \amp  0 \\
                0 \amp  1 \amp  0 \amp  \cdots \amp  0 \\
                0 \amp  0 \amp  1 \amp  \cdots \amp  0 \\
                \vdots \amp  \vdots \amp  \vdots \amp  \ddots \amp  \vdots \\
                0 \amp  0 \amp  0 \amp  \cdots \amp  1
                \end{bmatrix}  \in G
              </me>
              acts as an identity element for <m>\langle G, \cdot\,\rangle</m> since
              <me>
                AI_n=I_nA = A
              </me>
              for all <m>A\in G</m>.
            </p>
        <p> Finally, let <m>A\in G</m>.  Since <m>\det A\neq 0</m>, <m>A</m> has
              (matrix multiplicative) inverse <m>A^{-1}</m> in
              <m>\M_2(\R)</m>. But we need to verify that <m>A^{-1}</m> is in
              <m>G</m>. This is in fact the case, however, since
              <m>A^{-1}</m> is invertible (it has inverse <m>A</m>), hence <m>\det
              A^{-1} \neq 0</m>.  Thus, <m>A^{-1}</m> is also in <m>G</m>.
            </p>

      <p>
        So <m>G</m> is a group under multiplication.
      </p>

      <p>
        The proof that <m>SL(n,\R)</m> is a group under multiplication is left as an exercise for the reader.
      </p>
    </proof>

  </theorem>

  <p>
    These groups are very important in many areas of mathematics, including linear algebra and geometry. Because of this, we have special names for them (which give rise to the <q>GL</q> and <q>SL</q> in their names).
  </p>

  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        For <m>n\in \Z^+</m>, <m>GL(n,\R)</m> is called the <term>general
        linear group of degree <m>n</m> over <m>\R</m></term> and <m>SL(n,\R)</m> is
        called the <term>special linear group of degree <m>n</m> over
        <m>\R</m></term>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Define <m>*</m> on <m>\Q^*</m> by <m>a*b=(ab)/2</m> for all <m>a,b\in \Q^*</m>. Prove that <m>\langle \Q^*,*\rangle</m> is a group.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <proof>
      <p>
        First, <m>\Q^*</m> is closed under <m>*</m>, since <m>(ab)/2</m> is
        rational and nonzero whenever <m>a,b</m> are rational and nonzero.
      </p>

      <p>
        Next, we check that <m>\Q^*</m> under <m>*</m> satisfies the group
        axioms. Since multiplication is commutative on <m>\Q</m>, <m>*</m> is
        clearly commutative on <m>\Q^*</m>, and so our work to show
        <m>\G_2</m> and <m>\G_3</m> is marginally reduced.</p>
<p>
       First, associativity of <m>*</m> on <m>\Q^*</m> is inherited
              from associativity of multiplication on <m>\Q^*</m>.</p>
<p> Notice that the perhaps <q>obvious</q> choice, 1, is
              <em>not</em> an identity element for <m>\Q^*</m> under
              <m>*</m>: for instance, <m>1*3=3/2 \neq 3</m>. Rather, <m>e</m> is such an
              identity element if and only if for all <m>a\in \Q</m> we
              have <m>a=e*a=(ea)/2</m>. We clearly have <m>a=(2a)/2</m> for all
              <m>a\in \Q^*</m>; so <m>2</m> acts as an identity element for
              <m>\Q^*</m> under <m>*</m>.
            </p>            <p>
              Finally, let <m>a\in \Q^*</m>.  Since <m>a\neq 0</m>, it makes
              sense to divide by <m>a</m>; then <m>4/a\in \Q^*</m>, with
              <m>a*(4/a)=(a(4/a))/2=2</m>.
            </p>
        
      <p>
        Thus, <m>\langle \Q^*,*\rangle</m> is a group.
      </p>
    </proof>
