        A <term>permutation</term> on a set <m>A</m> is a bijection from <m>A</m>
        to <m>A</m>. We say a permutation <m>\sigma</m> on <m>A</m> <term>fixes</term> <m>a\in
        A</m> if <m>\sigma(a)=a</m>.

    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m> be the set <m>A=\{\Delta, \star, 4\}</m>. Then the functions <m>\sigma : A\to A</m> defined by
        <me>
          \sigma(\Delta)=\star,
          \sigma(\star)=\Delta,  \mbox{and }  \sigma(4)=4;
        </me>
        and <m>\tau : A\to A</m> defined by
        <me>
          \tau(\Delta)=4, 
          \tau(\star)=\Delta,  \mbox{and }  \tau(4)=\star
        </me>
        are
        both permutations on <m>A</m>.

      <p>
        Composition of permutations on a set <m>A</m> is often called
        <term>permutation multiplication</term>, and if <m>\sigma</m> and <m>\tau</m>
        are permutations on a set <m>A</m>, we usually omit the composition
        symbol and write <m>\sigma \circ \tau</m> simply as <m>\sigma \tau</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <warning>
    <p>
      For us, if <m>\sigma</m> and <m>\tau</m> are permutations on a set <m>A</m>, then applying <m>\sigma \tau</m> to <m>A</m> means first applying <m>\tau</m> and <em>then</em> applying <m>\sigma</m>. This is due to the conventional right-to-left reading of function compositions.
    </p>
  </warning>

  <p>
    That is, if <m>a\in A</m>, by <m>\sigma \tau(a)</m> we mean <m>\sigma(\tau(a))</m>. (Some other books/mathematicians do not use this convention, and read permutation multiplication from left-to-right.
    Make sure to always know what convention your particular author or colleague is using!)
  </p>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m>, <m>\sigma</m>, and <m>\tau</m> be as in <xref ref="stperm">Example</xref>.
        Then <m>\sigma \tau</m> is the function from <m>A</m> to <m>A</m> defined by
        <me>
          \sigma \tau(\Delta)=4,  \sigma \tau(\star)=\star,  \mbox{and }  \sigma \tau(4)=\Delta,
        </me>
        while <m>\tau \sigma</m> is
        the function from <m>A</m> to <m>A</m> defined by
        <me>
          \tau \sigma (\Delta)=\Delta,  \tau \sigma (\star)=4,  \mbox{and }  \tau \sigma(4)=\star

    <statement>
      <p>
        Given a set <m>A</m>, we let <m>S_A</m> be the set of all

    </statement>

  <theorem xml:id="sym">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Given a set <m>A</m>:
        <ol>
          <li>            <p>
              <m>S_A</m> is a group under permutation multiplication.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>            <p>
              If <m>A</m> has finite cardinality <m>n</m>, then <m>|S_A|=n!</m> (if <m>|A|=\infty</m> then <m>|S_A|</m> is also <m>\infty</m>).
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>            <p>
              <m>S_A</m> is abelian if <m>|A|=1</m> or <m>2</m>, and nonabelian otherwise.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
  

  <proof>
   
<ol><li><p>
      Let <m>\sigma, \tau \in S_A</m>. Since a composition of
      bijections is a bijection (see <xref ref="compbij">Theorem</xref>), <m>\sigma
      \tau</m> is a bijection from <m>A</m> to <m>A</m>, hence is in <m>S_A</m>. So
      <m>S_A</m> is closed under composition.</p> <p>Next,            function composition is always associative.</p><p> The identity function <m>1_A : A\to A</m> defined by
            <me>
              1_A(a)=a \mbox{ for all \(a\in A\)}
            </me>
            clearly acts as an
            identity element in <m>S_A</m>. Henceforth, we will denote <m>1_A</m>
            by <m>e</m>.
          </p>
        <p>
            Finally, let <m>\sigma \in S_A</m>.  Since <m>\sigma</m> is a
            bijection, <m>\sigma</m> has an inverse function <m>\sigma^{-1}</m>
            that is also a bijection from <m>A</m> to <m>A</m> (<xref ref="invbij">Theorem</xref>). Since <m>\sigma^{-1}\in S_A</m> with <m>\sigma
            \sigma^{-1}= \sigma^{-1} \sigma=1_A</m>, every element of
            <m>S_A</m> has an inverse element in <m>S_A</m>.
          </p>
    <p>
      So <m>S_A</m> is a group.
    </p></li>
<li>
  <p>
    Clearly <m>|S_A|=\infty</m> when <m>|A|=\infty</m>, and a straightforward
    combinatorial argument yields that when <m>|A|=n \in \Z^+</m>, we have
    <m>|S_A|=n!</m>.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, if <m>|A|=1</m> or <m>2</m>, then <m>|S_A|=1!=1</m> or
    <m>|S_A|=2!=2</m> so <m>S_A</m> must be abelian (as it's a group of order 1 or
    2). On the other hand, suppose <m>|A|>2</m>. Then <m>A</m> contains at least
    three distinct elements, say <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, and <m>z</m>. Let <m>\sigma</m> be the
    permutation of <m>A</m> swapping <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> and fixing every other
    element of <m>A</m>, and let <m>\tau</m> be the permutation of <m>A</m> swapping
    <m>y</m> and <m>z</m> and fixing every other element of <m>A</m>. Then <m>\sigma
    \tau(x)=y</m> while <m>\tau \sigma(x)=z</m>, so <m>\sigma \tau \neq \tau
    \sigma</m>, and hence <m>S_A</m> is nonabelian.</p></li></ol>
</proof>
</theorem>

<p>
    We will in the future use language provided by the following
    definition:
  </p>

  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A group is said to be a <term>permutation group</term> if it is
        a subgroup of <m>S_A</m> for some set <m>A</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <remark>
    <p>
      Notice
      that if <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are sets, then <m>|A|=|B|</m> if and only if
      <m>S_A\simeq S_B</m>.
    </p>
  </remark>

  <p>
    Thus, for any set <m>B</m> with <m>|B|=n \in \Z^+</m>, we have <m>S_B\simeq
    S_A</m>, where <m>A=\{1,2,\ldots,n\}</m>. Since we are concerned in this
    course primarily with group structures which are invariant under
    isomorphism, we may focus now on groups of permutations on the set
    <m>\{1,2,\ldots, n\}</m> (<m>n\in \Z^+</m>).<fn>We can, in fact,  define <m>S_0</m>, the set of all permutations on the empty set. One can show, using the fact that a function is a relation on a Cartesian product of sets, that <m>S_0</m> is the trivial group. However, this will not be relevant in this text.</fn></p>
