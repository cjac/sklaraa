  <title>Cayley's Theorem</title>
  <p>
    One might wonder how <q>common</q> permutation groups are in math. They
    are, it turns out, ubiquitous in abstract algebra: in fact, <em>every group</em> can be thought of as a group of permutations! We will
    prove this, but we first need the following lemma. (We will not use
    the maps <m>\rho_a</m> or <m>c_a</m>, defined below, in our theorem, but
    define them here for potential future use.)
  </p>

  <lemma xml:id="cay_lem">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>G</m> be a group and <m>a\in G</m>. Then the
        following functions are permutations on <m>G</m>, and hence are elements
        of <m>S_G</m>:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <title>(i)</title>
            <p>
              <m>\lambda_a\,:\,G\to G</m> defined by <m>\lambda_a(x)=ax</m>;
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <title>(ii)</title>
            <p>
              <m>\rho_a\,:\,G\to G</m> defined by <m>\rho_a(x)=xa</m>;
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <title>(iii)</title>
            <p>
              <m>c_a\,:\,G\to G</m> defined by <m>c_a(x)=axa^{-1}</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>

  <proof>
    <p>
      For (i): If <m>x_1,x_2 \in G</m> with
      <m>\lambda_a(x_1)=\lambda_a(x_2)</m>, then <m>ax_1=ax_2</m>; so, by left
      cancellation, <m>x_1=x_2</m>. Thus, <m>\lambda_a</m> is one-to-one. Further,
      each <m>y\in G</m> equals <m>\lambda_a(a^{-1}y)</m> for <m>a^{-1}y\in G</m>, so
      <m>\lambda_a</m> is onto. Thus, <m>\lambda_a</m> is a bijection from <m>G</m> to
      <m>G</m>: that is, it's a permutation on <m>G</m>. The proofs for <m>\rho_a</m> and
      <m>c_a</m> are similar.
    </p>
  </proof>
  </lemma>

   
<definition>
<statement>
<p>
We say that <m>\lambda_a</m>, <m>\rho_a</m>, and <m>c_a</m>
    perform on <m>G</m>, respectively, <term>left multiplication by <m>a</m></term>, <term>right multiplication by <m>a</m></term>, and <term>conjugation by <m>a</m></term>. (Nota
    bene: sometimes when people talk about conjugation by <m>a</m> they
    instead are referring to the permutation of <m>G</m> that sends each <m>x</m>
    to <m>a^{-1}xa</m>.)
  </p>
</statement>
</definition>

  <p>
    Now we are ready for our theorem:
  </p>

  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        (Cayley's Theorem) Let <m>G</m> be a group. Then <m>G</m>
        is isomorphic to a subgroup of <m>S_G</m>. Thus, every group can be
        thought of as a group of permutations.
      </p>
    </statement>
  

  <proof>
    <p>
      For each <m>a\in G</m>, let <m>\lambda_a</m> be defined, as above, by
      <m>\lambda_a(x)=ax</m> for each <m>x\in G</m>; recall that each <m>\lambda_a</m> is
      in <m>S_G</m>. Now define <m>\phi\,:\, G\to S_G</m> by <m>\phi(a)=\lambda_a</m>,
      for each <m>a\in G</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      We claim that <m>\phi</m> is both a homomorphism and one-to-one. Indeed,
      let <m>a,b\in G</m>. Now, <m>\phi(a)\phi(b)</m> and <m>\phi(ab)</m> are both
      functions with domain <m>G</m>, so we need to show
      <m>(\phi(a)\phi(b))(x)=(\phi(ab))(x)</m> for each <m>x\in G</m>. Well, let
      <m>x\in G</m>. Then
      <md>
        <mrow>(\phi(a)\phi(b))(x)\amp =(\lambda_a\lambda_b)(x)\amp \amp</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp =\lambda_a(\lambda_b(x)) \amp \amp \text{ (since the operation on \(S_G\) is
        composition) }</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp =\lambda_a(bx)\amp \amp</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp =a(bx)\amp \amp</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp =(ab)x\amp \amp</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp =\lambda_{ab}(x)\amp \amp</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp =(\phi(ab))(x).\amp \amp</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

    <p>
      So <m>\phi</m> is a homomorphism. Further, if <m>a, b\in G</m> with
      <m>\phi(a)=\phi(b)</m>, then <m>\lambda_a=\lambda_b</m>. In particular,
      <m>\lambda_a(e)=\lambda_b(e)</m>. But <m>\lambda_a(e)=ae=a</m> and
      <m>\lambda_b(e)=be=b</m>, so <m>a=b</m>. Thus, <m>\phi</m> is one-to-one.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since by definition <m>\phi(G)</m> we have that <m>\phi</m> maps <m>G</m> <em>onto</em> <m>\phi(G)</m>, we conclude that <m>\phi</m> provides an isomorphism
      from <m>G</m> to the subgroup <m>\phi(G)</m> of <m>S_G</m>.
    </p>
  </proof>
</theorem>
 
 <remark>

  <p>
    In general, <m>\phi(G) \neq S_G</m>, so we cannot
    conclude that <m>G</m> is isomorphic to <m>S_G</m> itself; rather, we may only
    conclude that it is is isomorphic to some <em>subgroup</em> of
    <m>S_G</m>.
  </p>

  </remark>

  <remark>
    <p>
      While we chose to use the maps <m>\lambda_a</m> to
      prove the above theorem, we could just as well have used the maps
      <m>\rho_a</m> or <m>c_a</m>, instead.
