  <title>Examples of groups/nongroups, Part II</title>
  <example>
    <p>
      Let <m>n\in \Z^+</m>. We define <m>n\Z</m> by
      <me>
        n\Z=\{nx: x\in \Z\}:
      </me>
      that is, <m>n\Z</m> is the set of all (integer) multiples of <m>n</m>.
    </p>
 </example>

    <theorem xml:id="nz">
      <statement>
        <p>
          <m>n\Z</m> is a group under <m>+</m> (the usual addition of integers).
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>

    <proof>
      <p>
        Let <m>x, y\in n\Z</m>. Then there exist <m>a,b\in \Z</m> such that <m>x=na</m> and <m>y=nb</m>. Then <m>x+y=na+nb=n(a+b)\in n\Z</m>. So <m>\langle n\Z,+\rangle</m> is a binary structure. The remainder of the proof is left as an exercise for the reader.
      </p>
    </proof>

  

  <remark>
    <p>
      When we are discussing a group <m>n\Z</m>, assume that <m>n\in \Z^+</m>, unless otherwise noted.
    </p>
  </remark>

  <p>
    We use an example from our next class of groups all the time;
    in fact, most six-year-olds do as well, since it is used when
    telling time! Before we get to the example, we need some more
    definitions and some notation. Throughout the following discussion,
    assume <m>n</m> is a fixed positive integer.
  </p>

  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        We say integers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are <term>congruent
        modulo [or mod] <m>n</m></term> if <m>n</m> divides <m>a-b</m>. If <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are
        congruent mod <m>n</m>, we write <m>a \equiv b\, \pmod{n}</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <example xml:id="cong_ex">
    <statement>
      <p>
        <m>1, 7, 13,</m> and <m>-5</m> are all congruent mod <m>6</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>

  <p>
    The following is a profoundly useful theorem; it's so
    important, it has a special name. We omit the proof of this theorem,
    but direct interested readers to for, instance, p. 5 in<nbsp /><xref ref="NZM" />.
  </p>

  <theorem>
<statement><p> (The Division Algorithm)

Let <m>n\in \Z^+</m> and let <m>a</m> be any
    integer. Then there exist unique integers <m>q</m> and <m>r</m>, with <m>0\leq
    r \lt n</m>, such that <m>a=qn+r</m>.<fn>This is actually a special case
    of a more general theorem, which states that given any integers <m>n</m>
    and <m>a</m>, there exist unique integers <m>q</m> and <m>r</m>, with <m>0\leq
    r\lt |n|</m>, such that <m>a=qn+r</m>.</fn>
  </p>
</statement>
</theorem>

  <p>
    It follows that for each positive integer <m>n</m> and integer <m>a</m>,
    there exists a unique element <m>R_n(a)</m> (the <m>r</m> in the above
    theorem) of the set <m>\{0,1,2,\ldots, n-1\}</m> such that <m>a</m> is
    congruent to <m>R_n(a)</m> modulo <m>n</m>. For example, <m>R_3(4)=1</m>, <m>R_3(0)=0</m>,
    <m>R_3(17)=2</m>, and <m>R_3(-5)=1</m>.
  </p>

  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        <m>R_n(a)</m> is the <term>remainder</term> when we divide <m>a</m> by <m>n</m>. (Note: You were probably already familiar with the remainder when you divide a <term>positive</term> integer by <m>n</m>.)
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        We define <term>addition modulo <m>n</m></term>, <m>+_n</m>, on <m>\Z</m> by,
        for all <m>a,b\in \Z</m>,
        <me>
          a+_n b=R_n(a+b),
        </me>
        that is, the unique element of <m>\{0,1,\ldots, n-1\}</m> that's congruent to the integer <m>a+b</m> modulo <m>n</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <remark>
    <p>
      Addition mod 24 is what we use to tell
      time!
    </p>
  </remark>

  <p>
    The set <m>\{0,1,2,\ldots, n-1\}</m> of remainders when dividing by <m>n</m> is so important we give it a
    special notation.
  </p>

  <notation>

  <p>
    We denote by <m>\Z_n</m> the set <m>\{0,1,2,\ldots,n-1\}</m>.
  </p>

  </notation>

  <p>
    Throughout this course, if we are discussing a set <m>\Z_n</m>, you
    should assume <m>n\in \Z^+, n\geq 2</m>, unless otherwise noted.
    (Though it will rarely come up for us, we may occasionally make
    reference to <m>\Z_1=\{0\}</m>.)
  </p>

  <warning>
    <p>
      Note that by our definition of <m>\Z_n</m>, the
      integer <m>n</m> itself is <em>not</em> in <m>\Z_n</m>!
    </p>
  </warning>

  <p>
    We are now ready to consider our next type of group.
  </p>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        For each <m>n\in \Z^+</m>, <m>\langle \Z_n,+_n\rangle</m> is a group, called the <em>cyclic group of order <m>n</m></em> (we will see later why we use the word <q>cyclic</q> here).
        This group is abelian and of order <m>n</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <proof>
      <p>
        We first check that <m>\Z_n</m> is closed under <m>+_n</m>. Note
        that by the definition of <m>+_n</m>, <m>a+_nb \in \Z_n</m> for each
        <m>a,b\in \Z</m>. Thus, <m>a+_nb \in \Z_n</m> for each <m>a,b\in \Z_n</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        We next check that <m>\Z_n</m> under <m>+_n</m> satisfies the three group
        axioms. Note that since addition is commutative on <m>\Z</m>,
        <me>
          a+_n
          b =R_n(a+b)=R_n(b+a)=b+_n a
        </me>
        for all <m>a,b\in \Z_n</m>. Again, a
        simpler way of stating this is that commutativity of <m>+_n</m> on
        <m>\Z_n</m> is inherited from the commutativity of addition on <m>\Z</m>.
        One nice result of this is that since <m>+_n</m> is commutative on
        <m>\Z_n</m>, we have less to check when verifying group axioms
        <m>\G_2</m> and <m>\G_3</m>.</p>


            <p>
              Now, let <m>a,b,c\in \Z_n</m>.  We want to show that
              <m>(a+_n b)+_n c = a +_n(b+_n c)</m>. Now,
              <md>
                <mrow>(a+_n b)+_n c\amp =R_n(a+b)+_n c\amp \amp</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp \equiv R_n(a+b)+c\amp \amp  \pmod n</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp \equiv (a+b)+c\amp \amp   \pmod n</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp \equiv a+(b+c)\amp \amp   \pmod n</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp \equiv a+R_n(b+c)\amp \amp   \pmod n</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp \equiv a+_n (b+_n c)\amp \amp  \pmod n.</mrow>
              </md>
              So <m>(a+_n b)+_n c</m> and <m>a+_n (b+_n c)</m> are congruent mod <m>n</m>.  Since
              both of these values are in <m>\{0,1,\ldots, n-1\}</m>, this implies that
              they are equal, as desired.
            </p>
            <p>
              Next, clearly, <m>0\in \Z_n</m> acts as an identity element
              under <m>+_n</m>, since
              <me>
                0+_n a =R_n(0+a)=R_n(a)
              </me>
              for each
              <m>a\in \Z_n</m>.
            </p>
          <p>Finally, let <m>a\in \Z_n</m>.  If <m>a=0</m>, then clearly <m>a</m> has
              inverse <m>0\in \Z_n</m> since <m>0+_n 0 = 0</m>. If <m>a\neq 0</m>, then
              the element <m>n-a\in \Z_n</m> is an inverse for <m>a</m> since
              <me>
                a+_n(n-a)=R_n(a+(n-a))=R_n(n)=0.
              </me>
            </p>

      <p>
        Since <m>+_n</m> is commutative on <m>\Z_n</m>, <m>\Z_n</m> is an abelian group under <m>+_n</m>. </p>
<p>
Finally, we already know that <m>|\Z_n|=|\{0,1,2,\ldots,n-1\}|=n</m>.
      </p>
    </proof>

  </example>

  <remark>
    <p>
      In practice, we often omit the
      subscript <m>n</m> and just write <m>+</m> when discussing addition
      modulo <m>n</m> on <m>\Z_n</m>.
    </p>
  </remark>

  <warning>
    <p>
      Do not confuse <m>n\Z</m> and <m>\Z_n</m>! They are very different as sets and as groups.
    </p>
  </warning>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        In the group <m>\langle \Z_8,+\rangle</m> (where, as indicated by our above remark, <m>+</m> means addition modulo <m>8</m>), we have, for instance, <m>3+7=2</m> and <m>7+7=6</m>.
        The numbers 2 and 6 are each other's inverse, and <m>7^{-1}=1</m>. The number <m>0</m> has inverse <m>0</m> (it can't be <m>8</m>, since <m>8\not\in \Z_8</m>!).
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>

  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        For <m>n\in \Z^+</m>, we define binary operation <m>\cdot_n</m> (<term>multiplication modulo <m>n</m></term>) on <m>\Z_n</m> by <m>a\cdot_n b = r_n(a)</m>, the remainder when <m>ab</m> is divided by <m>n</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <remark>
    <p>
      <m>\Z_n</m> is never a group under <m>\cdot_n</m> (do you see why?).
    </p>
  </remark>

  <p>
    But we can consider the following
  </p>

  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        For <m>n\in \Z^+</m>,
        let <m>\Z_n^{\times} = \{a\in \Z_n\,:\,\gcd(a,n)=1\}</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        <m>\langle \Z_n^{\times},\,\cdot\, \rangle</m> is a group under multiplication. We omit the proof.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>

  <p>
    We end by considering a few more examples.
  </p>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>F</m> be the set of all functions from <m>\R</m> to <m>\R</m>, and define <em>pointwise addition</em> <m>+</m> on <m>F</m> by
        <me>
          (f+g)(x)=f(x)+g(x)
        </me>
        for all <m>f,g\in F</m> and <m>x\in \R</m>. We claim that <m>F</m> is a group under pointwise
        addition. (For variety, in this proof we don't explicitly refer
        to <m>\G_1</m><ndash /><m>\G_3</m>, though we certainly do verify they hold.)
        Indeed, if <m>f,g\in F</m> then clearly <m>f+g</m> is also a function
        from <m>\R</m> to <m>\R</m>, so <m>F</m> is closed under <m>+</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Next, let <m>f,g,h\in F</m>. Then for all <m>x\in \R</m>,
        <md>
          <mrow>((f+g)+h)(x)\amp =(f+g)(x)+h(x)\amp \amp</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp =((f(x)+g(x))+h(x)\amp \amp</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp =f(x)+(g(x)+h(x))\amp \amp \text{ (since addition is associative on
          \(\R\)) }</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp =f(x)+(g+h)(x)\amp \amp</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp =(f+(g+h))(x)\amp \amp .</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>

      <p>
        Note
        that the key fact used in this argument is that <m>f(x)</m>, <m>g(x)</m> and
        <m>h(x)</m> all lie in <m>\R</m>, and addition is associative on <m>\R</m>.
        When you get used to such arguments, it is sufficient to say that
        associativity of <m>+</m> on <m>F</m> is <em>inherited</em> from the
        associativity of addition on <m>\R</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Next, let <m>z:\R\to\R</m> be the function <m>z(x)=0</m> for all <m>x</m>. Then for all <m>f\in F</m> and <m>x\in \R</m>,
        <me>
          (f+z)(x)=f(x)+z(x)=f(x)+0=f(x)=0+f(x)=z(x)+f(x)=(z+f)(x).
        </me>
      </p>

      <p>
        So <m>z</m> is an identity element of <m>\langle F,+\rangle</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, let <m>f\in F</m>, and define <m>g\in F</m> by <m>g(x)=-f(x)</m> for all <m>x\in \R</m>. It is easy then to see that <m>g</m> is an inverse for <m>f</m> in <m>F</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hence, <m>F</m> is a group under pointwise addition. Note that it is uncountably infinite and abelian.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The set <m>F</m> is <em>not</em> a group under function composition (do you see why?). But if we define <m>B</m> to be the set of all <em>bijections</em> from <m>\R</m> to <m>\R</m>, then <m>B</m> is a group under function composition. (Prove it!) <m>B</m> is uncountably infinite and nonabelian.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>

  <example xml:id="gpprod">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>\langle G_1,*_1\rangle</m>, <m>\langle G_2,*_2\rangle</m> , <m>\ldots</m>, <m>\langle G_n,*_n\rangle</m> be groups (<m>n\in \Z^+</m>). Then the <em>group product</em>
        <me>
          G=G_1\times G_2\times \cdots \times G_n
        </me>
        is a group under the <em>componentwise</em> operation <m>*</m> defined by
        <me>
          (g_1,g_2,\ldots, g_n)*(h_1,h_2,\ldots,h_n)=(g_1*_1h_1, g_2*_2h_2,\ldots, g_n*_nh_n)
        </me>
        for all <m>(g_1,g_2,\ldots, g_n),(h_1,h_2,\ldots,h_n)\in G</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        For instance, considering multiplication on <m>\R^*</m>, matrix multiplication on <m>GL(2,\R)</m>, and addition modulo <m>6</m> on <m>\Z_6</m>, we have that <m>\langle \R^*\times GL(2,\R) \times \Z_6,*\rangle</m> is a group in which, for instance,
