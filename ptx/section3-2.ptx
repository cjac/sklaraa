  <title>Introduction to homomorphisms and isomorphisms</title>

    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>\langle S,*\rangle</m> and <m>\langle S',*'\rangle</m> be binary structures. A
        function <m>\phi</m> from <m>S</m> to <m>S'</m> is a <term>homomorphism</term> if
        <me>
          \phi(a* b)=\phi(a)*'\phi(b)
        </me>
        for all <m>a,b\in S</m>. An <term>isomorphism</term> is a homomorphism that is also a bijection.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    Intuitively, you can think of a homomorphism <m>\phi</m> as a
    <q>structure-preserving</q> map: if you multiply and then apply <m>\phi</m>,
    you get the same result as when you first apply <m>\phi</m> and then
    multiply. Isomorphisms, then, are both structure-preserving and
    cardinality-preserving.
  </p>

  <note>

  <p>
    We may omit the <m>*</m> and <m>*'</m>, as per our group conventions, but we include them here to emphasize that the operations in the structures may be distinct from one another. When we omit them and write <m>\phi(st)=\phi(s)\phi(t)</m>, then it is the writers' and readers' responsibility to keep in mind that <m>s</m> and <m>t</m> are being operated together using the operation in <m>S</m>, while <m>\phi(s)</m> and <m>\phi(t)</m> are being operated together using the operation in <m>S'</m>.

  <remark>
    <p>
      There may be more than one homomorphism
      [isomorphism] from one binary structure to another (see <xref ref="homos">Example</xref>).

      <p>
        For each of the following, decide whether or not the given function
        <m>\phi</m> from one binary structure to another is a homomorphism, and,
        if so, if it is an isomorphism. Prove or disprove your answers! For
        Parts 6 and 7, <m>C^0</m> is the set of all continuous functions from
        <m>\R</m> to <m>\R</m>; <m>C^1</m> is the set of all differentiable functions
        from <m>\R</m> to <m>\R</m> whose derivatives are continuous; and each
        <m>+</m> indicates pointwise addition on <m>C^0</m> and <m>C^1</m>. (Note that
        <m>C^1</m> and <m>C^0</m> are not groups, since elements of them will not have
        inverses unless they are bijections.)

        Let <m>\Gdot</m> be a group and let <m>a\in G</m>. Then the
        function <m>c_a</m> from <m>G</m> to <m>G</m> defined by <m>c_a(x)=axa^{-1}</m> (for
        all <m>x\in G</m>) is a homomorphism. Indeed, let <m>x,y\in G</m>. Then
        <md>
          <mrow>c_a(xy)\amp =a(xy)a^{-1}</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp =(ax)e(ya^{-1})</mrow>

        The homomorphism <m>c_a</m> is called
        <em>conjugation by <m>a</m></em>.<fn>Homomorphisms from a group <m>G</m> to
        itself are called <em>automorphisms</em>. Thus, conjugation by any
        element <m>a</m> in <m>G</m> is an automorphism of <m>G</m>. (Beware: Some texts
        refer to the function <m>x\mapsto a^{-1}xa</m> as ``conjugation by
        <m>a</m>." Either version of conjugation by <m>a</m> in group <m>G</m> is an
        automorphism of <m>G</m>.)</fn></p>

    We end with a theorem stating basic facts about
    homomorphisms from one group to another. (<em>Note.</em> This doesn't apply to arbitrary binary structures, which may or may not even have identity elements.)
  </p>

  <theorem xml:id="homoprops">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>\langle G,\cdot\rangle</m> and <m>\langle G',\cdot'\rangle</m> be groups with identity elements <m>e</m> and <m>e'</m>, respectively, and let <m>\phi</m> be a homomorphism from <m>G</m> to <m>G'</m>. Then:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>\phi(e)=e'</m>; and
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              For every <m>a\in G</m>, <m>\phi(a)^{-1}=\phi(a^{-1})</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>

  <proof>
    <p>
      For Part 1, note that
      <md>
        <mrow>\phi(e)\cdot'e'\amp =\phi(e)\amp \amp \text{ (by definition of \(e'\)) }</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp =\phi(e\cdot e) \amp \amp \text{ (by definition of \(e\)) }</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp =\phi(e)\cdot'\phi(e) \amp \amp \text{ (since \(\phi\) is a homomorphism). }</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

    <p>
      Thus, by left
      cancellation, <m>e'=\phi(e)</m>. The proof of Part 2 is left as an exercise for the reader.
