  <p>
    Note that every <m>k</m>-cycle <m>(a_1a_2\ldots a_k)\in S_n</m> can be written as a product of (not necessarily disjoint) transpositions:
    <me>
      (a_1a_2\ldots a_k)=(a_1a_n)(a_1a_{n-1})\cdots(a_1a_3)(a_1a_2).
    </me>
  </p>

  <p>
    We therefore have the following theorem.
  </p>

  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Every permutation in <m>S_n</m> can be written as a product of transpositions.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>

  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        We say that a permutation in <m>S_n</m> is <term>even</term> [resp., <term>odd</term>] if it can be written as a product of an even [resp., odd] number of transpositions.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Every permutation in <m>S_n</m> is even or odd, but not both.
      </p>
    </statement>

  <proof>
    <p>
      We already know that every permutation is <m>S_n</m> is a product of transpositions, so must be even or odd. For proof that no permutation is both even <em>and</em> odd, see, for instance, Proof 1 or 2 of Theorem 9.15 on p. 91 in<nbsp /><xref ref="F" />.
    </p>
  </proof>

  </theorem>

  <lemma xml:id="evenodd">
    <statement>
      <p>
        For each <m>2\leq k\leq n</m>, then a <m>k</m>-cycle is even if <m>k</m> is odd, and odd if <m>k</m> is even.
      </p>
<p>The proof of this is left as an exercise for the reader.</p>
    </statement>
</lemma>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        In <m>S_3</m>, the permutations <m>e</m>, <m>(123)=(13)(12)</m>, and <m>(132)=(12)(13)</m> are even, while the permutations <m>(12)</m>, <m>(13)</m>, and <m>(23)</m> are odd.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        List all of the even [resp., odd] permutations in <m>S_4</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>

  <p>We have the following theorem, whose proof is left as an exercise for the reader.</p>

<theorem>
<statement><p>
 The set of all even permutations in <m>S_n</m> is a subgroup of <m>S_n</m>. 
  </p>
</statement>
</theorem>

  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>The <term>alternating group on <m>n</m> letters</term> is the subgroup <m>A_n</m> of <m>S_n</m> consisting of all of the  even permutations in <m>S_n</m>.      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    We end with this theorem, whose proof can be found on p. 93 of<nbsp /><xref ref="F" />.
  </p>

  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        <m>A_n=(n!)/2</m>.
