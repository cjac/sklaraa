      Before we discuss more examples, we present a theorem and look at some conventions we follow and notation we use when discussing groups in general; we also discuss some properties of groups.

  <subsection>
    <title>Some group conventions</title>
    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The identity element of a group is
          unique (by <xref ref="uniqueid">Theorem</xref>), and given any element <m>a</m>
          of a group <m>G</m>, the inverse of <m>a</m> in <m>G</m> is unique (by <xref ref="uniqueinverse">Theorem</xref>).
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          We usually <em>don't</em> use the notation <m>*</m> when describing group
          operations. Instead, we use the multiplication symbol <m>\cdot</m> for
          the operation in an arbitrary group, and  call
          applying the operation <q>multiplying</q><mdash />even though the operation may
          not be <q>multiplication</q> in the non-abstract, traditional sense! It may
          actually be addition of real numbers, composition of
          functions, etc.


          Moreover, when actually operating in a group <m>\langle G, \cdot\,\rangle</m>, we
          typically omit the <m>\cdot</m> . That is, for <m>a,b\in G</m>, we write the
          product <m>a\cdot b</m> as <m>ab</m>. We call this the <q>product</q> of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>. We will generally use <m>e</m>
          or <m>e_G</m> as our default notation for an identity element of group,<fn>Many mathematicians denote a group's identity element by 1, rather than <m>e</m>.</fn>and <m>a^{-1}</m> to denote the inverse of element <m>a</m> in <m>G</m>.

          <warning>
            <p>
              Although it is what we call <em>multiplicative
              notation</em> for an inverse, do <em>not</em> assume <m>a^{-1}</m> is what we usually think of as a
              multiplicative inverse for <m>a</m>; remember, we don't even know if
              elements of a group are numbers! The type of inverse that <m>a^{-1}</m>
              is (a multiplicative inverse for a real number? an additive inverse
              for a real number? a multiplicative inverse for a matrix? an inverse
              function for a function from <m>\fatr</m> to <m>\fatr</m>?) depends on both
              <m>G</m>'s elements and its operation.
            </p>
          </warning>

        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          For every element <m>a</m> in a group <m>\Gdot</m> and <m>n\in \Z^+</m>, we use the expression <m>a^n</m> to denote  the product
          <me>
            \stackrel{\underbrace{a\cdot a \cdot \,\cdots \,\cdot a}}{n \mathrm{ times}}
          </me>
          and <m>a^{-n}</m> to denote <m>(a^{-1})^n</m> (that is, the product of <m>n</m> copies of <m>a^{-1}</m>).
          Finally, we define <m>a^0</m> to be <m>e</m>.  Note that our <q>usual</q> rules for exponents then hold in an arbitrary group: that is, if <m>a</m> is in group <m>\langle G, \cdot\,\rangle</m>
          and <m>m,n\in \Z</m>, then <m>a^m a^n = a^{m+n}</m> and <m>(a^m)^n=a^{mn}=(a^n)^m</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      There are exceptions to these conventions:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            When working with an operation that is known to be commutative, we typically
            continue to use additive notation (<m>+</m> for the group operation, <m>-a</m>
            for the inverse of element <m>a</m> in the group) and call the operation
            <q>addition,</q> though using <m>\cdot</m> is also valid in these cases. When
            we use additive notation, we do <em>not</em> omit the <m>+</m> when
            operating in a group <m>\langle G,+\rangle</m>, and we call <m>a+b</m> a <em>sum</em> rather
            than a product.<fn>Also, when working with an operation that is known to be commutative, the identity element may be denoted by 0 rather than by <m>e</m>, <m>e_G</m>, or 1.</fn>For <m>n\in \Z^+</m>, we write <m>na</m> instead of <m>a^n</m>; we also write <m>0a</m> instead of <m>a^0</m>. Finally, note that
            <m>(-n)a=n(-a)=-(na)</m> (where <m>-a</m> and <m>-(na)</m> indicate the
            additive inverses of <m>a</m> and <m>na</m>, respectively); we can therefore
            unambiguously use the notation <m>-na</m> for this element.
            Using this notation, note that for <m>m\in \Z</m>, <m>na+ma=(n+m)a</m> and <m>n(ma)=(nm)a</m>.

            <warning>
              <p>
                Be careful to always know where an element
                you are working with lives! For instance, if, as above, <m>n\in
                \Z^+</m> and <m>a</m> is a group element, <m>-n</m> and <m>-a</m> look similar but
                may mean very different things. While <m>-n</m> is a negative integer,
                <m>-a</m> may be the additive inverse of a matrix in <m>\M_2(\fatr)</m>, the
                additive inverse 2 of the number 4 in <m>\Z_6</m>, or even something
                completely unrelated to numbers.
              </p>
            </warning>

            We summarize multiplicative versus addition notation in the following table, where <m>a,b</m> are elements of a group <m>G</m>.

            We <em>do</em> use the notation
            <m>*</m> when using multiplicative or additive notation would lead to
            confusion. For instance, if we want to define an operation on
            <m>\fatq^*</m> that assigns to pair <m>(a,b)</m> the quantity <m>ab/2</m>, it would
            be unwise to use multiplicative or additive notation for this
            operation since we already have conventional meanings of <m>ab</m> and
            <m>a+b</m>. Similarly, we would not denote the identity element of
            <m>\fatq^*</m> under this operation by <m>0</m> or <m>1</m>, since the identity
            element in this group is the rational number <m>2</m>, and writing <m>0=2</m>
            or <m>1=2</m> would look weird.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            If there is a default notation for a particular
            operation (say, <m>\circ</m> for composition of functions) or identity
            element (say, <m>I_n</m> in <m>GL(n,\fatr)</m>) we usually use that notation
            instead.

  <subsection>
    <title>Some group properties</title>
    <p>
      While we don't need to worry about <q>order</q> when multiplying a group element <m>a</m> by itself, we <em>do</em> need to worry about it in general.
    </p>

    <warning>
      <p>
        Group operations need <em>not</em> be commutative!
      </p>
    </warning>

    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A group <m>\langle G, \cdot\,\rangle</m> is said to be <term>abelian</term><fn>The word <q>abelian</q> is derived from the surname of
          mathematician Niels Henrik Abel.</fn>if <m>ab=ba</m> for all <m>a,b\in
          G</m>. Otherwise, <m>G</m> is <term>nonabelian</term>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <remark>
      <p>
        If we know that a binary operation <m>\cdot</m>
        on a set <m>G</m> is commutative, then in checking to see if axioms
        <m>\G_2</m> and <m>\G_3</m> hold we need only verify that there exists
        <m>e\in G</m> such that <m>ae=a</m> (we don't need to check that
        <m>ea=a</m>) for all <m>a\in G</m> and that for each <m>a\in G</m> there
        exists <m>b\in G</m> such that <m>ab=e</m> (we don't need to check that
        <m>ba=e</m>).
      </p>
    </remark>

    <remark>
      <p>
        If <m>G</m> is not known to be abelian, we
        must be careful when multiplying elements of <m>G</m> by one
        another: multiplying on the left is, in general, not the same
        as multiplying on the right!
      </p>
    </remark>

    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>G</m> is a group, then the cardinality <m>|G|</m> of <m>G</m> is
          called the <term>order of <m>G</m></term>. If <m>|G|</m> is finite, then <m>G</m> is
          said to be a <term>finite group</term>; otherwise, it's an <term>infinite group</term>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Of the groups we've discussed, which are abelian? Which are infinite/finite?
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>

    <p>
      We have already seen that identity elements of groups are unique,
      and that each element <m>a</m> of a group <m>G</m> has a unique inverse
      <m>a^{-1}\in G</m>. Here are some other basic properties of groups.
    </p>

    <theorem xml:id="cancel">
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>\Gdot</m> is a group, then <em><em>left and right cancellation laws</em></em> hold in <m>G</m>. That is, if <m>a,b,c\in G</m>, then
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                If <m>ab=ac</m>, we have <m>b=c</m> (the left cancellation law); and
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                If <m>ba=ca</m>, we have <m>b=c</m> (the right cancellation law).
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>

    <proof>
      <p>
        Let <m>a,b,c\in G</m> and assume that <m>ab=ac</m>. Multiplying
        both equation sides on the left by <m>a^{-1}</m>, we obtain
        <md>
          <mrow>{2}
          \amp \amp  a^{-1}(ab)\amp =a^{-1}(ac)</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp \Rightarrow
          \amp (a^{-1}a)b\amp =(a^{-1}a)c</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp \Rightarrow
          \amp eb\amp =ec</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp \Rightarrow
          \amp b\amp =c</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>

      <p>
        This proves that the left cancellation law holds. A similar proof shows that the right cancellation law holds.
      </p>
    </proof>

    <theorem xml:id="uniquesols">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>\Gdot</m> be a group and let <m>a,b\in G</m>. Then there exist <em><em>unique</em></em> elements <m>x,y\in G</m> such that <m>ax=b</m> and <m>ya=b</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>

    <proof>
      <p>
        If <m>x=a^{-1}b</m> and <m>y=ba^{-1}</m>, then
        <m>ax=a(a^{-1}b)=(aa^{-1})b=eb=b</m> and
        <m>ya=(ba^{-1})a=b(a^{-1}a)=be=b</m>. So such elements <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>
        exist. The fact that they are unique follows from the cancellation
        laws: if <m>ax=b</m> and <m>ax'=b</m> then <m>x=x'</m> by left cancellation, and
        if <m>ya=b</m> and <m>y'a=b</m> then <m>y=y'</m> by right cancellation.
      </p>
    </proof>

    <warning>
      <p>
        We only of necessity have <m>(ab)^{-1}=a^{-1}b^{-1}</m> if <m>G</m> is known to be abelian!
      </p>
    </warning>

    <p>
      However, we do have the following:
    </p>

    <theorem xml:id="invofprod">
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are elements of a group <m>\Gdot</m>, then
          <me>
            (ab)^{-1}=b^{-1}a^{-1}.
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>

    <proof>
      <p>
        We have that
        <me>
          (ab)(b^{-1}a^{-1})=a(bb^{-1})a^{-1}=aea^{-1}=aa^{-1}=e.
        </me>
      </p>

      <p>
        Similarly, <m>(b^{-1}a^{-1})(ab)=e</m>.
