        Let <m>S</m> be a set. Then a collection of subsets
        <m>P=\{S_i\}_{i\in I}</m> (where <m>I</m> is some index set) is a <term>partition</term> of <m>S</m> if each <m>S_i \neq \emptyset</m> and each element
        of <m>S</m> is in exactly one <m>S_i</m>. In other words,
        <m>P=\{S_i\}_{i\in I}</m> is a partition of <m>S</m> if and only if:
        <ol>
          <li>
       
            <p>
              each <m>S_i\neq \emptyset</m>;

          <li>            <p>
              the <m>S_i</m> are mutually disjoint (that is, <m>S_i\cap S_j =

        The <m>S_i</m> are called the <term>cells</term> of the partition.

            The set <m>\{1,2,3\}</m> has 5 partitions: namely,
            <me>
              \{\{1,2,3\}\},\{\{1,2\},\{3\}\}, \{\{1,3\},\{2\}\},\{\{2,3\},\{1\}\} \mbox{ and }  \{\{1\},\{2\},\{3\}\}.
            </me>
            The first partition we've mentioned has one cell, the next three have
            two cells, and the last one has three cells.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            The following is a 2-celled partition of <m>\Z</m>:
            <me>
              \{\{x\in \Z\,:\ x \mbox{
              is even} \},\{x\in \Z\,:\, x\mbox{ is odd} \}\}.

  <p>
    The number of partitions of a finite set of <m>n</m> elements gets
    large very quickly as <m>n</m> goes to infinity. Indeed, there are 52
    partitions of a set containing just 5 elements!<fn>The total
    number of partitions of an <m>n</m>-element set is the <em>Bell number</em>,
    <m>B_n</m>. There is no trivial way of computing <m>B_n</m>, in general,
    though the <m>B_n</m> do satisfy the relatively simple recurrence
    relation
    <me>
      B_{n+1}=\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} B_k,
    </me>
    for each <m>n\geq 1</m>.</fn>But our goal here is not to count the number of
    partitions of a given set, but rather to use particular partitions
    of a group <m>G</m> to help us study that group's structure. We turn now
    to our next definition.

        Let <m>S</m> be a set. Then a <term>relation</term> on <m>S</m> is a
        subset <m>R</m> of <m>S\times S</m>.<fn>More generally, if <m>S</m> and
        <m>T</m> are sets, a <em>relation between <m>S</m> and <m>T</m></em> is a subset
        of <m>S \times T</m>. We will not, however, in our class consider
        the cases in which <m>S</m> and <m>T</m> are different sets.</fn>If <m>R</m> is
        a relation on <m>S</m> and <m>x,y\in S</m>, then we say <m>x</m> is <term>related to</term> <m>y</m>, and write <m>x R y</m>, if <m>(x,y)\in R</m>;
        otherwise, we say that <m>x</m> is <term>not related</term> to <m>y</m>, and
        write <m>x \not R y</m>.

  <remark>
    <p>
      If there is a conventional notation used to denote
      a particular relation on a set, we will usually use that notation,
      rather than <m>R</m>, to denote the relation.
    </p>
  </remark>

  <p>
    We are already familiar with some relations on
    <m>\R</m>. Common such relations are <m>=</m>, <m>\neq</m>, <m>\lt</m>, <m>\leq</m>, <m>></m>,
    and <m>\geq</m>; they contain exactly the elements we'd expect them to
    contain.

        <li>

            <m>\lt</m> is a relation on <m>\R</m> that contains, for instance, <m>(3,4)</m> but not
            <m>(3,3)</m> or <m>(4,3)</m>; <m>\leq</m> is a relation on <m>\R</m> that contains

            Given any <m>n\in \Z^+</m>, congruence modulo <m>n</m>, denoted <m>\equiv_n</m>, is a

            We can define a relation <m>R</m> on <m>C^1</m> (the set of

            whose derivatives are continuous) by declaring that
            <m>(f,g)\in C^1 \times C^1</m> is in <m>R</m> if and only if

          You can think of an
          equivalence relation on a set <m>S</m> as being a <q>weak version</q> of
          equality on <m>S</m>.  Indeed, <m>=</m> is an equivalence relation on any set
          <m>S</m>, but it also has a very special property that most equivalence
          relations <em>don't</em> have: namely, no element of <m>S</m> is related to
          <em>any other element</em> of <m>S</m> under <m>=</m>.

          If we know, or plan to prove, that a relation is an equivalence

  <lemma xml:id="vil_lem">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>\sim</m> be an equivalence relation on set <m>S</m>. Then for <m>x,y\in S</m>, the following are equivalent:
<p>
<ol>
<li><p><m>y\in [x]</m>;</p></li>
<li><p><m>[x]=[y]</m>;</p></li>
<li><p><m>x\in [y]</m>.</p></li>
</ol>
     </p></p>
    </statement>
  </lemma>

  <proof>
    <p>
      To prove that the first and second statements are equivalent: Let <m>x, y\in S</m>. If <m>y\in
      [x]</m>, then <m>y \sim x</m>, so for every <m>z\in [y]</m> (that is, for every
      <m>z</m> in <m>S</m> with <m>z\sim y</m>), we have, by transitivity, <m>z\sim x</m>, so
      <m>z\in [x]</m>. On the other hand, by the symmetry of <m>\sim</m> we have
      <m>x\sim y</m>; so for every <m>z\in [x]</m>, we have, again by transitivity,
      that <m>z\in [y]</m>. Thus, <m>[x]=[y]</m>. Conversely, if <m>[x]=[y]</m>, then
      since <m>y\in [y]=[x]</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The proof that the second and third statements are equivalent is nearly
      identical.

            Consider the equivalence relation <m>\equiv_2</m> on

  </theorem>

  <proof>
    <p>
      To prove the first statement: Let <m>\sim</m> be an equivalence relation on <m>S</m>.
      Clearly, the equivalence classes of <m>S</m> under <m>\sim</m> are
      nonempty sets whose union is <m>S</m>. Thus, it suffices to show <m>X
      \cap Y =\emptyset</m> for each pair of equivalence classes <m>X\neq
      Y</m> of <m>S</m> under <m>\sim</m>. Let <m>X,Y</m> be equivalence classes of
      <m>S</m> under <m>\sim</m> that are NOT disjoint. Then there exists an
      element <m>z\in X\cap Y</m>. Then by <xref ref="vil_lem">Lemma</xref>, <m>[z]=X</m>
      and <m>[z]=Y</m>; so <m>X=Y</m>. Thus, if <m>X\neq Y</m>, then <m>X\cap Y
      =\emptyset</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, it is straightforward (almost silly!) to prove that
      <m>\sim</m> is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.
