  <title>The Isomorphism Theorems</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Recall that our goal here is to use a subgroup of a group <m>G</m> to
      study not just the structure of the subgroup, but the structure of
      <m>G</m> outside of that subgroup (the ultimate goal being to get a
      feeling for the structure of <m>G</m> as a whole). We've further seen
      that if we choose <m>N</m> to be a normal subgroup of <m>G</m>, we can do this
      by studying both <m>N</m> and the factor group <m>G/N</m>. Now, we've noticed
      that in some cases<mdash />in particular, when <m>G</m> is cyclic<ndash />it is not
      too hard to identify the structure of a factor group of <m>G</m>. But
      what about when <m>G</m> and <m>N</m> are more complicated? For instance, we
      have seen that <m>SL(5,\R)</m> is a normal subgroup of <m>GL(5,\R)</m>.
      What is the structure of <m>GL(5,\R)/SL(5,\R)</m>? That is not so
      easy to figure out by looking directly at left coset multiplication
      in the factor group.
